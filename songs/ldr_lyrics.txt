Title: 13 Beaches

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
It took thirteen beaches to find one empty
But finally, it's mine
With drippin' peaches, I'm camera ready
Almost all the time

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But I still get lonely
And baby, only then do I let myself recline
Can I let go, and let your memory dance
In the ballroom of my mind?
Across the county line

[Chorus]
It hurts to love you, but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lyin', if I kept hidin'
The fact that I can't deal
And that I've been dyin'
For somethin' real
That I've been dyin' for somethin' real

[Verse 2]
It took thirteen beaches to find one empty
But finally, I'm fine
Past Ventura and lenses plenty
In the white sunshine

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But you still can find me, if you ask nicely
Underneath the pines
With the daisies, feelin' hazy
In the ballroom of my mind
Across the county line

[Chorus]
It hurts to love you, but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lyin', if I kept hidin'
The fact that I can't deal
And that I've been dyin'
For somethin' real
That I've been dyin' for somethin' real

[Outro]
It hurts to love you, but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lying', if I kept hidin'
The fact that I can't deal
The fact that I can't deal


Title: 1949

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Carry me up them stairs
With my white socks on
And my pretty song
You like my blue nail polish?
"What is all this?" You said
Of the mess upstairs
Don't be scared

[Pre-Chorus]
Daddy dearest, you know
How I like to take trips
Pops, first stops at the K-mart, buy me my peach lip gloss
Cigarettes and lollipops
For our trip across the USA

[Chorus]
We're gonna party like it's 1949
We're in the Pontiac from July to July
Gonna see it all before he says goodbye
Gonna party like it's 1949

[Verse 2]
Carry me up them stairs
With my white socks on
And my blonde hair long
You like my pin-up bodice and the solace
That comes with the midnight air
And my icy stare

[Pre-Chorus]
It's the clearest when it's me and him alone
He stops, he talks about all ways he used to let up
Dinerettes and soda pops for our trip across the USA

[Chorus]
We're gonna party like it's 1949
We're in the Pontiac from July to July
Gonna see it all before he says goodbye
Gonna party like it's 1949

[Outro]
Daddy likes Blackpool Pleasure Beach and road stops
Me, I like the Swiss Alps souvenir gift shops
Late night, midnight radio show talks
Him and me, a big jailbreak

Ponytail and lollipops, dinerettes and soda pops
New blue bathing suit, ruched tops and Cadillacs
Blue lake, Carter Docks, hopscotch, hot talk
Alabama hard knocks, motel brass locks


Title: 24

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
There's only twenty-four hours in a day
And half as many ways for you to lie to me, my little love
There's only twenty-four hours in a day
And half of those, you lay awake
With thoughts of murder and carnage

[Pre-Chorus]
If you lie down with dogs, then you'll get fleas
Be careful of the company you keep

[Chorus]
There's only twenty-four hours
And that's not enough
To lie like you lie
Or love like you love

[Post-Chorus]
Hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm

[Verse 2]
There's only twenty-four hours in a day
And half of those you lay
Between the sheets with me, my lying love
There's only twenty-four hours, so you'd say
For most of them you pay
For all the things they paid you for, my love

[Pre-Chorus]
If you lie down with dogs, then you'll get fleas
Be careful of the ones you choose to leave

[Chorus]
There's only twenty-four hours
And that's not enough
To lie like you lie
Or love like you love

[Post-Chorus]
Hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm

[Bridge]
Give me your heat
Give me your diamonds
You hit that street
And my crooked words
You count to three
While they're all dying
You're hard to reach
You're cold to touch

[Outro]
La-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-di-da-da-da


Title: 4th of July

Lyrics:
[Chorus]
I can be your 4th of July
I can be your 4th of July
I can be your 4th of July
I can be your 4th of July
I can be your 4th of July
I can be your 4th of July

[Post-Chorus]
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that crystal
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that crystal
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that crystal meth, love
Because

[Outro]
Feels like sugar in me
Feels like sugar in me
Feels like sugar in me
Feels like sugar in me
Feels like sugar in me


Title: 80's Baby

Lyrics:
You're my 80's baby, beating on my covers
You soul is wild, for you're not like the others
Rock and roll is a lifestyle, they don't get it
We give new meaning to the sound of heavy metal

Want you, I need you to take me tonight
Need you, to leave me, to lie

You're my 80's, my 80's baby, yeah
You're my 80's, my 80's baby, yeah

You're my 80's baby, beating on my covers
Your hair is long, your life is rich, roaring waters
And you, you got a soul like no one, no other
You got roses in your eyes, sittin' sweet on alma maters

Rape me, I rеally need you to save me tonight
Hold me, nowhеre to hide

You're my 80's, my 80's baby, yeah
You're my 80's, my 80's baby, yeah

I want you, I want you, I want you
And I need you, I need you, I need you
And I want you, I want you, I want you
And I need you, [?]

I get closer to the [?]

Got my 80's, my 80's baby, yeah
You're my 80's, you're my 80's
My 80's baby
My 80's baby

You're my 80's, you're my 80's
My 80's baby
My 80's baby


Title: Afraid

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I'm America's Sweetheart
Trying to get away
You make it hard to leave
But it's easier for me to stay
I am so afraid
And I've had it up to here
With the fighting, baby, we're
Not fooling anyone these days
I don't wanna stray
But boy, I'm so afraid

[Pre-Chorus]
But it's not love that keeps me here
And it's not what you want to hear

[Chorus]
So I'm going
Back to Santa Monica
New York to L.A
Never coming back, boy
No matter what you do or say
'Cause I'm so afraid
And I've had it up to here
With the panic and the fear
There's nothing in your heart
Thought that I could make you change
I'm so afraid

[Verse 2]
We were just teenagers when we fell in love
Driving in your fast car
Looking at the stars above
But it was not enough
You should never come between
A woman and her dream
And a man that never knew his place
There's no easy way
To come back from where you came

[Chorus]
So, baby, now I'm going
Back to Santa Monica
New York to L.A
Never coming back, boy
No matter what you do or say
'Cause I'm so afraid
I-I've had it up to here
With the panic and the fear
Nothing in your heart, boy
I thought that I could make you change
I'm so afraid

[Bridge]
And it's not love, it's just the fear
That you've put down for all these years

[Chorus]
But I'm leaving now
I'm going
Back to Santa Monica
New York to L.A
Never coming back, boy
No matter what you do or say
I am done being afraid
Oh, I've had it up to here
With the panic and the fear
There's nothing in your heart
I thought that I could make you change
I'm so afraid

[Outro]
Oh, it's not love that keeps me here
It's not love that keeps me here
I'm done being afraid
I'm done being afraid
Oh, oh, oh


Title: All Eyes on Me*

Lyrics:
[Chorus:Lana Del Rey]
When I'm dancing, everybody's looking at me
All eyes on me feeling like Britney
I'm trying to escape, but the paparazzis got me
I can't hide, because I have all eyes on me

[Verse 1: Young Miami]
I ride his dick like a motorcycle
We seduce each other, it's a whole cycle

[Chorus:Lana Del Rey]

Give me the cash or I shoot ya

[Chorus:Lana Del Rey]
When I'm dancing, everybody's looking at me

I can't hide, because I have all eyes on me

[Bridge: Lana Del Rey & Young Miami]
I'm tired of this shit (Period)
I can't do this anymore (That's right)
I'm trying to escape (Why?)
But I can't cause I have  all eyes on me

[Chorus:Lana Del Rey]
When I'm dancing, everybody's looking at me
All eyes on me feeling like Britney
I'm trying to escape, but the paparazzis got me
I can't hide, because I have all eyes on me


Title: All For You

Lyrics:
[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
You, it's you it's all for you
Everything I do, I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls, Honey is that true?

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Made it lost it came back flipped it
Always faded, lifted
Hit that corner whipped it
Hit the dealer, whipped it
Always on it, mind your business
I'm always high, the sky ain't the limit
Ball like Melo, cars all tinted
Chain black and yellow, Pittsburgh Steelers
Sport it knocked it tossed it flipped it
Took my flow and switched it, took my dough invested
Your whole life is scripted
All we do is party, drinkin', molly raggin', shawty raggin'
Money come retarted huh, press the button start it up
Tryna be a dope boy ridin' with a coke boy
Strap with the low boy 50 for a show boy
Niggas made it rain I made I it snow boy
Started with a dollar and a hope boy
Now a nigga hot got millions in the bank
Crib on the water spend a milly on the tank
Montana piece look silly on the link
Montana and Wiz spend millys on the dank

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
You, it's you it's all for you
Everything I do, I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls, Honey is that true?

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Smoking weed in my expensive car
I'm ridin' high I'm flyin' high
Told you niggas say the shit you want
So don't even take the chance or try to try my guy
Designer sayin' supplies gettin' low
Weed man say it's kinda dry
Potty mouth, rockstar, at the top and still tryna climb
Drop the top sit back recline
Hundred-K that's just the ride
Fifty-K that's just the change
Thirty-K that's just the time
Tour came that's just in time
That's more racks, that's more racks
Private plane you know that's flyin'
I'm boardin' that I'm boardin' that
Rollin' up smoke roy ridin' with the coke boy
Smoking on strong pack hit it once choke boy
When I'm on the road bottles like dope boy
When the police come, I don't really know boy
Half a pound in seven days that's smokin'
If you ain't bout your family or getting bread you jokin'

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
You, it's you it's all for you
Everything I do, I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls, Honey is that true?

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Pick up the pace, turn up the bass
I'm singing this right in your face
I made the call forgive me
Cause I did this all for you
So whether you do or whether you don't
This gon' bang and this gon' bump
Hit your J or split your blunt
DPG then we turned up
Blue bandana, French Montana
All around the world first class
VIP, bubble bath
Touchdown, two points
Wide reciever Khalifa bless me with two joints
They told big dick Dogg, he gotta get up on this hit dog
Turn it up let me hear the beat for a second
Have a few puffs then I breathe on the record
Then we go like merri-go, round and round
This right here is for the underground
I wonder how, I break it down for you

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
You, it's you it's all for you
Everything I do, I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls, Honey is that true?


Title: All over us

Lyrics:
Baby, if word gets out that we're here
The press will be all over us


Title: All Smiles

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
All dressed up, with nowhere to go
That's the story of the girl you know
Me
I'm all smiles but inside I frown
Cause I've seen you walkin' around with Betty Lou
Didn't I tell you what I heard about her?

[Chorus 1]
It don't matter to you
It don't matter to you
It don't matter to you what them other girls do
You'll date anyone, you'll date anyone

[Verse 2]
Are they more fun than me, baby?
I'm smiling, the New Jersey queen
And you're the best thing I ever seen
So won't you pull up your white corvette
Jimmy, let me get a better look at your face
I know it ain't doing
But I know what you like
So come on inside and I'll fix you ice-cream
A little banana split for you, Jim

[Verse 3]
You're so fine, you're like silk la roux
Guess that's why you keep slipping through my fingers
You're the state's number one
Everybody knows it
You smile all the time
Cause how can you not show it
When even you know
That you're so
To die for, to die for
What do I need to get high for?
When I have you
When I have you

[Chorus 2]
It don't matter to you
It don't matter to you
It don't matter to you what those other girls done
I'm gonna prove to you
I'm gonna prove to you
You'll never find nobody more fun
Dah, dah, dah
More fun


Title: All You Have to Do is Change Everything...

Lyrics:
You can have a life beyond your wildest dreams
All you have to do is change everything…
All you have to do is change everything
All you have to do is change everything
All you have to do is change everything


Title: All You Need

Lyrics:
You have a right to live your life
Like no one else does, like no one else might
If you have visions, come on and live them out

All you need is some peace while you are here
Just let go until you are home, dear

I had a dream when I was young
I dreamt our lives were going to be fun
We were always waiting to live

All you need is some peace while you are here
Just let go of it all, dear

You have a choice to hear the noise
Or hear the sweet sound of your sweet voice
I know I've heard it, I heard it in my sleep

All you need is some peace while you are here
Just let go, don't say no, dear

Wake up each night at the same time
Roll up the blind and look outside
And in the orange light, the fog is rising

This is life, this tonight, peace in the quiet
Happiness is the sky


Title: Alma Mater

Lyrics:
[Intro: Lana Del Rey]

Maybe you'd like some of Jack's newer stuff, or
One, two, one, two, one, two

[Chorus: Jack Antonoff, Lana Del Rey, Both]
She's my alma mater
Chasin' lines all night (Alma mater)
Smokin' me outta sight
Well, summer's gettin' hotter (Alma mater)
Threw her T-shirt down the pike (Alma mater)

As she alligator cries (Lana)
I'll make it darker
2003, sad all the time (Alma mater)

[Verse 1: Jack Antonoff]

Point the headlights, flickеr dear
Drive by the old housе, go for a beer
We're on the green or the movie theatre
You're a movie to me, the way you move around me

[Chorus: Jack Antonoff, Lana Del Rey]
She's my alma mater
Well, summer's gettin' hotter (Alma mater)
Threw her T-shirt down the pike (Alma mater)

[Verse 2: Jack Antonoff, Lana Del Rey]
Some dreams, I wake up thinkin' 'bout
Some dreams are meant to die (Alma mater)
Kill Your Idols in the street outside in daylight
'Cause if we walk, we'll get high tonight
Shoulder to the wheel tonight
Joke about blowin' town tonight (Alma mater)
Until we drive past my alma mater

[Bridge: Lana Del Rey]
Alma mater

[Chorus: Jack Antonoff, Lana Del Rey, Both]
She's my alma mater
Chasin' lines all night
Smokin' me outta sight
Well, summer's gettin' hotter
Threw her T-shirt down the pike (Yeah)
Screamin', "Fuck Balenciaga"
Right past the Wawa
Threw on "Heartattack and Vine"
As she alligator cries (Lana)
I'll make it darker

Play house, put my favorite record on
Get down, get your crystal method on
You were like tall, tan, driving 'round the city

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

Do the flame-colored skies light your fire?
We are heavy metal lions
They will never understand
The kind of people you or I am
Bow your heads and take your hands

Rock 'n' roll guardians now
The last keepers of the light

Forever angels (angels, angels)

Title: Arcadia

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
My body is a map of LA
I stand straight like an angel with a halo
Hangin' out the Hilton Hotel window
Screamin', "Hey, you, baby, let's go"
My chest, the Sierra Madre
My hips, every high and byway
That you trace with your fingertips like a Toyota
Run your hands over me like a Land Rover

[Chorus]
In Arcadia, Arcadia
All roads that lead to you as integral to me as arteries
That pump the blood that flows straight to the heart of me
America, America
I can't sleep at home tonight, send me a Hilton Hotel
Or a cross on the hill, I'm a lost little girl
Findin' my way to you, Arcadia

[Verse 2]
My body is a map of LA
And my heart is like paper, I hate you
I'm not from the land of the palms, so I know I can't stay here
I'm not native, but
My curves, San Gabriel all day
And my lips like the fire licks the bay
If you think that you know yourself, you can come over
Lay your hands on me like you're a Land Rover

[Chorus]
In Arcadia, Arcadia
All roads that lead to you as integral to me as arteries
That get the blood flowing straight to the heart of me
America, I need a miracle
I can't sleep at home tonight, send me a Hilton Hotel
Or a cross on the hill, I'm a lost little girl
Findin' my way to you, Arcadia

[Outro]
They built me up three-hundred feet tall just to tear me down
So I'm leavin' with nothing but laughter and this town
Arcadia
Findin' my way to you
I'm leavin' them as I was, five-foot-eight, Western belt
Plus the hate that they gave
By the way, thanks for that, on the way, I'll pray for you
But you'll need a miracle, America


Title: Art Deco

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Club queen on the downtown scene
Prowling around at night
You're not mean, you're just born to be seen
Born to be wild
A little party never hurt no one, that's why it's alright
You want in but you just can't win
So you hang in the lights

[Chorus]
You're so Art Deco out on the floor
Shining like gunmetal, cold and unsure
Baby, you're so ghetto, you're looking to score
When they all say hello, you try to ignore them

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause you want more (Why?)
You want more (Why?)
You want more (Why?)
'Cause you want more

[Verse 2]
Young thing on the downtown scene
Rolling around at night
Got things that have yet to be seen
Like your rapper's delight
A little party never hurt no one, that's why it's alright
You want in, but you just can't win
So you stay in the lights

[Chorus]
You're so Art Deco out on the floor
Shining like gunmetal, cold and unsure
Baby, you're so ghetto, you're looking to score
When they all say hello, you try to ignore them

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause you want more (Why?)
You want more (Why?)
You want more (Why?)
'Cause you want more

[Bridge]
A little party never hurt no one
So you stay out late
A little party never hurt no one
That's what your friends say
You put your life out on the line
You're crazy all the time
Put your life out on the line
You're crazy all the time

[Chorus]
You're so Art Deco out on the floor
Shining like gunmetal, cold and unsure
Baby, you're so ghetto, you're looking to score
When they all say hello, you try to ignore them

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause you want more (Why?)
You want more (Why?)
You want more (Why?)
'Cause you want more

[Outro]
A little party never hurt no one
Not you and me
A little party never hurt no one
We were born to be free


Title: Asleep

Lyrics:
Intro:
Don’t ask me for permission
Not anymore, u should die already
I think it’s time

Verse 1:
Doin on each other
This seems a little strange
And i don’t wanna visit it
Cuz i think you bother for whatever i say
It’s getting little overwhelming
I know you are, showing him our bed
I want to escape, i don’t want to live like

Chorus:
If i only knew u were…. asleep
I would leave, i would leave

Verse 2:
If i only knew you before
I would do it differently
Boppin floppin everywhere
Trying to reach me

Bridge:
One with the baseball
Bat in the pen
Two with the sword, stick, strike
& defend
Three with a kick spin
Make her the king pin
Closes her eyes when she’s
Counting to ten, four with the
Bullseye shot
Five with the flare when the
Target’s hot (mm,hmm)

Lyrics:
[Chorus]
Well you know it and I know it
I'm gonna be a star
You won't, you won't get me very far

[Verse 1]
Don't say hello
It's already time to go
Oh, the wind is carrying me home
Me home, me home again

[Chorus]
Well you know it and I know it

To what you know

The cicadas in the sunset are your guide
Sing Ave Maria honey
Sing Ave Maria


Title: Aviation

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Do you think I'm crazy
For considering aviation?
I'm a fan of flying
Why not do it for the nation?
Cause I have nothing else to do
This summer but commit it to you
Have a big degree in philosophy
But I don't know what I want to be

[Chorus]
So I'm going into aviation, yeah, mom
I'm going into aviation, yeah, dad
Going into aviation
I'm going into aviation

[Verse 2]
Do you think I'm crazy
Cause I'm up and leaving, baby?
Well, I ain't got nobody
And I ain't got no money, baby, yeah
I feel high as I might tonight
So lean back and enjoy the ride
And the weather is clear, yeah, nobody is near
The future is not here

[Chorus]
So I'm going into aviation, yeah, mom
I'm going into aviation, yeah, dad
Going into aviation
I'm going into aviation

[Verse 3]
Do you think I'm crazy
Cause I'm going to Pensacola?
Where nobody knows me
Where someone could just start over
I'll be all right in a month or two
Cause it's warm there in the winter, too
Think New York is great, I really like the state
But it's time to be on my way

[Chorus]
I'm going into aviation, yeah, mom
I'm going into aviation, yeah, dad
I'm gonna take a vacation, yeah, man
Fly fighter jets all over the nation
Fly fighter jets all over the nation


Title: A&W

Lyrics:
[Part I]

[Verse 1]
I haven't done a cartwheel since I was nine
I haven't seen my mother in a long, long time
I mean, look at me
Look at the length of my hair and my face, the shape of my body
Do you really think I give a damn
What I do after years of just hearing them talking?

[Pre-Chorus]
I say I live in Rosemead, really, I'm at the Ramada
It doesn't really matter, doesn't really, really matter

[Chorus]
Call him up, "Come into my bedroom"
Ended up, we fuck on the hotel floor
It's not about havin' someone to love me anymorе
This is the experiеnce of bein' an American whore

[Verse 2]
Called up one drunk, called up another
Forensic Files wasn't on
Watching Teenage Diary of a Girl
Wondering what went wrong
I'm a princess, I'm divisive
Ask me why, why, why I'm like this
Maybe I'm just kinda like this
I don't know, maybe I'm just like this

[Pre-Chorus]
I say I live in Rosemead, really, I'm at the Ramada
It doesn't really matter, doesn't really, really matter

[Chorus]
Call him up, he comes over again
Yeah, I know I'm over my head, but, oh
It's not about havin' someone to love me anymore
No, this is the experience of bein' an American whore

[Verse 3]
I mean, look at my hair
Look at the length of it and the shape of my body
If I told you that I was raped
Do you really think that anybody would think
I didn't ask for it? I didn't ask for it
I won't testify, I already fucked up my story
On top of this (Mm), so many other things you can't believe
Did you know a singer can still be
Looking like a sidepiece at thirty-three?
Got a cop who turned on the backbeat
Puts the shower on while he calls me
Slips out the back door to talk to me
I'm invisible, look how you hold me
I'm invisible, I'm invisible
I'm a ghost now, look how you hold me now

[Chorus]
It's not about havin' someone to love me anymore (Oh, okay)
No, this is the experience of bein' an American whore
It's not about havin' someone to love me anymore
No, this is the experience of bein' an American whore
[Part II]

[Intro]
This is the experience of bein' an American whore
This is the experience of bein' an American whore
This is the experience of bein' an American whore
Woo

Your mom called, I told her, you're fuckin' up big time

[Verse]
Jimmy, you should switch it up, baby, light it up (Yeah)
Jimmy, if you leave the house, find me in the club (Like)
Jimmy, if you switch it up, you should light it up
Jimmy, if you leave the house, find me in the club (Like, surf's up)
Your mom called, I told her, you're fuckin' up big time
But I don't care, baby, I already lost my mind
Jimmy, if I lie it up, find me in the club (Mind, mind)
Your mom called, I told her, you're fucking up big time

[Chorus]
Jimmy, Jimmy, cocoa puff, Jimmy, Jimmy, ride
Jimmy, Jimmy, cocoa puff, Jimmy, get me high
Love me if you love or not, you can be my light

Pour me up a bit of that liquid courage
Lookin so good, like an Axl Rose

Take us back to class, so we look like heaven
You say I'm so fine that it hurts

Walking them streets like the queen of hearts
Laughing at nothin' we’re alone together
Where your night ends, ours starts

Baby blue

[Bridge]

Will you or won't you do anything to love me?
Cause I'm a bad girl and I got a good plan
Bank across the street, you're a dangerous man
They ask you who's sweet, you tell them I am, baby blue, baby blue

[Chorus]
I'm on fire but what can I do?
I'm singing in the choir but I'm lookin' at you

We got a jumper

My man's crazy and his mind isn't right
But I like him, fact, I love him

He knows only I can save him tonight

[Chorus]
I've been waiting on your love
Baby, for too long now, too long now

Gonna backfire, gonna backfire, baby
Told you a million times before
Yes, I'm up for it a million more

[Verse 2]
I'm tired of fighting you
Seems like everything I do
Even when I win, I lose wit' you, man
And it's not somethin' you choose
You say trouble follows you
It's been like that since the day you began

[Pre-Chorus 2]
We got a jumper
Got a jumper

I know very well you're bringing me down
I will follow, I will follow
For a little piece of heaven
I am ready, I am willing to drown

Baby, for too long now, too long now
I thought that I could change you like the others
But I don't know how, don't know how
It's gonna backfire

Gonna backfire, gonna backfire, baby
We've done it a million times before
Yes, I'm up for it a million more

[Bridge]
We're always taking trips downtown
Officer Brown's always coming around
Tapping on our windows, "Kids, come out
Ain't no way to live, let me show you how"
But we know we're not gonna change
Keep hustlin' every night and day

[Chorus]
I've been waiting on your love
Baby, for too long now, too long now
I thought that I could change you like the others
But I don't know how, don't know how
It's gonna backfire
It's gonna backfire, baby
Gonna backfire, gonna backfire, baby
Done it a million times before
And I'll run for it a million more


Title: Backpack Karma

Lyrics:
[Intro]

Right
Yeah
Okay, yeah!
Okay, yeah!
Speir with me

[Verse]

Karma and the universes' schedule are fighting (Yeah)
I’m a cool one that’s ignited
I’m a sinner living righteously (Yeah)
A miracle when sighted in a customary life (Yeah)
And I might say that I don’t like it but I write so I love it ayy
One more time for the people in the back (Alright)
When I write it then I love it
It’s a fact
And I’m ready to attack (Alright)
I get a snack
And then I pack
More than 17 albums in my backpack
What i lack i get (get it)
Ready? Ready for this?
I’ma tell you what you missed
Living life beneath the light like an abyss
Take a fucking risk (Risk)
Everyday’s a shot to get a look into the mist
Have it written on my wrist
Heaven written on my chest
Find me with the devil playin' chess
In the cloud escaping mess
‘Cause i really need to rest

[Billie Eilish]
Psych!

[Outro: Speir & Conan Grey]
Sing it to me!
Now my life is sweet like cinnamon
Like a fucking dream I'm living in
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio (oh)


Title: Back To Tha Basics

Lyrics:
[Intro]
C'mon

[Verse 1]
Baby, we could go back to the basics
Trailer park love, wearing them ASICS and gold
I can speak Spanish
You can sing for the neighbors
You've been pretty stupid ever since you got famous

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, wrong side of the tracks, boy
Oh-oh, oh-oh, if only we'd go backward
'Cause nobody does it like you
I like the way that you move
That's why I never go through
With leaving you

[Chorus]
Everybody's saying that you're no good for me
Your friends all swear that you've changed
But I still keep it O.G
This tune could be a reminder of how it all used to be
So shut up, and come on, sing our song
And let's go back to the basics
Let's go back to the basics, baby
Back to the basics
When you're not wasted, I know you'll see

[Verse 2]
Baby, we could go back to the basics (C'mon)
We were best friends, crazy and shameless in love
You can mow the lawn for money
I can make you playlists
You bought me dimebags
Felt like we were famous

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, best I ever had boy
Oh-oh, oh-oh, can you remember that, boy?
Nobody knew what we knew
We had it figured out, too
Us against the world just
Me and you (Ooh)

[Chorus]
Everybody's saying that you're no good for me
Your friends all swear that you've changed
But I still keep it O.G
This tune could be a reminder of how it all used to be
So shut up, and come on, sing our song
And let's go back to the basics
Let's go back to the basics, baby
Back to the basics
When you're not wasted, I know you'll see

[Bridge]
We could drive forever, my baby
We could leave it all and never look back
If you wanted heaven, baby
Sit back in my pink Cadillac

[Breakdown]
Everybody's saying that you're no good for me
Your friends all swear that you've changed
But I still keep it O.G
This tune could be a reminder of how it all used to be
So shut up, and come on, sing our song
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Chorus]
Everybody's saying that you're no good for me
Your friends all swear that you've changed
But I still keep it O.G
This tune could be a reminder of how it all used to be
So shut up, and come on, sing our song
And let's go back to the basics
Let's go back to the basics, baby
Back to the basics
When you're not wasted, I know you'll see


Title: Backyard

Lyrics:
Let them b***** feel it, more than a hundred reasons I should be dead no longer breathing now I see it, the truth is scary but I don't sweat it, females out to get you, for many reason, they want the money and the fame for many reasons, but I stay loyal to the game through the rainy season no treason. Switch your Game up or get left behind


Title: Bad Boy

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
My baby likes me fresh in my white kicks
I'm sweet like cherry pie, and he likes this
I buy him drinks and he buys me cigarettes
He thinks that we're a little bit like Romeo and Juliet
Throw me 'round like a hot potato, if he want the butter, then say so
It's wrong, but well, it's okay though
It's okay though

[Chorus]
Baby ghetto love
Mama knows I like the bad boys
Baby ghetto love
Just like daddy was a bad boy
Ooh, ahh
Take me out tonight, baby save my life
Ooh, ooh
Take me out tonight, baby save my life
True love, true love, true love
It never dies, it never dies, it never dies
True love, true love, true love
It never dies, it never dies

[Verse 2]
My baby likes me fresh in my white kicks
He thinks it's a little like hair, tits, lips, sips
It doesn't really matter that I do my lipstick all day long, all day long
My baby likes me fresh in my white kicks
Dear Bonnie and Clyde, it's just like this
He thinks a little like my polka dot dress on
He like my hair long

[Chorus]
Baby ghetto love
You know no one loves you better
Baby ghetto love
You can be oh be no better
Ooh, ooh
Take me out tonight, baby save my life
Ooh, ooh
Take me out tonight, baby save my life

[Bridge]
Save my life, save my life, save my life
Save my life, save my life, save my life
Save my life, save my life, save my life
'Cause true love never dies
It's what I want
When I see what's up high
True love never dies

[Chorus]
Baby ghetto love
Mama knows I like the bad boys
Baby ghetto love
Just like daddy was a bad boy
True love, true love, true love
It never dies, it never dies, it never dies
True love, true love, true love
It never dies, it never dies


Title: Bad Disease

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Well, there is something about watching a crime
It makes me want to go out and make it all mine
It's something about seeing you fight
It makes me want to go out tonight

[Hook]
I got a bad disease
I got a bad disease
To fall into
Yeah, it's true

[Verse 2]
There's something about seeing him die
That puts it all into perspective and I
Want to stay home, be left alone
Someone make my mind up so I don't have to decide

[Hook]
I got a bad disease
I got a bad disease
To fall into
Yeah, I do

[Verse 3]
There's some reason why I can't sit still
Every waking moment I feel so unfulfilled
I try to lie down, but I don't know how
Baby, when I'm sleeping, it feels less like I am dreaming

[Chorus]
Oh, my god
I got a bad disease
I got a bad disease
It's got me down
On my knees

[Verse 4]
There's a fear I have of feeling real bad
I'm fine now, if I find out that I'm not I'll be sad
I try to quiet the thoughts in the night
Oh, they got me thinking, I'd be happier just drinking

[Outro]
It's not true
And I got a bad disease
I got a bad disease
It's got me down
On my knees
Oh, no
I got a bad disease
Will no one help me please?
Not even you?


Title: Bad For You*

Title: Bare Feet on Linoleum

Lyrics:
[Stanza 1]
Stay on your path Sylvia Plath
don't fall away like all the others

[Stanza 2]
Don't take all your secrets alone to your watery grave about
lovers and -

[Stanza 3]
The secrets you keep will keep you in deep like Amy and -
And brother
And all of the people you meet on the street will reiterate lies
that they uttered

[Stanza 4]
Leave me in peace, I cry
In the middle of the night
On a slow boat bound for Catalina for no reason

[Stanza 5]
Tiny drops of perspiration dot my forehead
could be mistaken for dew drops if this were photo season

[Stanza 6]
But alas this is a real life - and it's been a real fight just to
stop my mind from committing treason
Why you ask?
Because she told the townspeople I was crazy, and the lies, they
started to believe them

[Stanza 7]
But anyways - that's all over now

[Stanza 8]
I've moved on, gone scorched earth
And now I'm left wondering where to go from here
To Sonoma where the fires have just left?
South Dakota?

[Stanza 9]
Would standing in front of Mount Rushmore feel like the Great
American homecoming I never had?

[Stanza 10]
Would the magnitude of the scale of the sculptures take the place
of the warm embrace I've never got?

[Stanza 11]
Or should I just be here now
Bare feet on linoleum
Slicing vegetables onto water that I will later turn
into stew

[Stanza 12]
People love my stories
People love visions


Title: Bartender

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
All the ladies of the canyon
Wearing black to their house parties
Crosby, Stills and Nash is playing
Wine is flowing with Bacardi

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But sometimes, girls just want to have fun
The poetry inside of me is warm like a gun

[Chorus]
I bought me a truck in the middle of the night
It'll buy me a year if I play my cards right
Photo-free exits from baby's bedside
'Cause they don't yet know what car I drive
I'm just tryna keep my love alive
With my bartender, hold me all night
Bartender, our love's alive
Baby, remember, I'm not drinking wine
But that Cherry Coke you serve is fine
And our love's sweet enough on the vine
Bartender, bar-t-t-tender

[Verse 2]
All the ladies of the canyon
Wearing white for their tea parties
Playing games of levitation
Meditating in the garden

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I love the little games that we play
From the valley to the beach
And when at last the day is done, I grab my keys

[Chorus]
I bought me a truck in the middle of the night
It'll buy me a year if I play my cards right
Photo-free exits from baby's bedside
'Cause they don't yet know what car I drive
I'm just tryna keep my love alive
With my bartender, hold me all night
Bartender, our love's alive
Baby, remember, I'm not drinking wine
But that Cherry Coke you serve is fine
And our love's sweet enough on the vine
Bar-t-t-tender, bar-t-t-tender, bar-t-t-tender
Ha, ha, ha, ha

[Outro]
I bought me a truck in the middle of the night
60 MPH on PCH drive
Here to Long Beach to Newport by your side
As they don't yet know where I reside
60 miles from the last place I hide
With my bar-t-t-tender, hold me all night
Bar-t-t-tender, keep love alive
Bar-t-t-tender


Title: BBM Baby

Title: Beach Boys

Lyrics:
[Intro]
We have the Beach Boys blastin' in our white car
This is who we really are, Jersey Shore trailer parks
Me and Jimmy and our friends, this is where the story ends

[Verse 1]
Late truck stop nights
Wearin' blue jeans tight, wearin' blonde hair high
Girls are in their gold lamé
Betty-Lou and Lana Ray dreamin' about Monterrey
Maybe in a month or two
Monterrey, Monterrey, Monterrey

[Chorus]
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Never was thеre ever a girl morе pretty
Do you wanna get low-down and gritty?
Do you wanna go back out again?
We stop at 7-Eleven in his white Pontiac heaven
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love forever?

[Verse 2]
I can see the sparkle in your eyes
I can see it now as I get closer
From what I've heard, it's no surprise
You're more crazy than a rollercoaster
You're more crazy than a rollercoaster

[Chorus]
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl more pretty
Do you wanna get low-down and gritty?
Do you wanna do the heroin? Ah-ah
We stop at 7-Eleven in his white Pontiac heaven
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love forever?

[Bridge]
I don't know
But I see the signs, see the signs
I see the signs
But I see the signs
I shine as if I know anything
But I know the king

[Outro]
You're the king
You're the king, you're the king
You're the king, you're the king


Title: Beautiful

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Let's keep it simple, babe
Don't make it complicated
Don't tell me to be glad when I'm sad
I really hate that
I try not to be bad
Eccentricity's holding me back
If I could be more like you, I would
But I can't and I'm glad about that

[Pre-Chorus]
What if someone had asked Picasso not to be sad?
Never known who he was or the man he'd become
There would be no blue period
Let me run with the wolves, let me do what I do
Let me show you how sadness can turn into happiness
I can turn blue into something

[Chorus]
Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful like you
Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful like you

[Verse 2]
Let's keep it simple, babe
We can't afford to change it
Don't turn me into something I'm not
There's no way to sustain it
I try not to hold back
It seems, either way, it makes you mad
So I'll be who I'll be, if you think that that's cool
Then I'll take you back

[Pre-Chorus]
What if someone had asked Picasso not to be sad?
Never known who he was or the man he'd become
There would be no blue period
Let me run with the wolves, let me do what I do
Let me show you how sadness can turn into happiness
I can turn blue into something

[Chorus]
Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful like you
Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful like you

[Chorus]
Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful like you
Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful like you

Blue is the color of the planet from the view above
Long live our reign, long live our love
Green is the planet from the eyes of a turtle dove
'Til it runs red, runs red with blood

[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
We get so tired and we complain
'Bout how it's hard to live
It's more than just a video game

But we're just beautiful people
With beautiful problems, yeah
Beautiful problems, God knows we've got them
But we gotta try (Lie-la-lie)
Every day and night (Lie-la-lie)

[Verse 2: Stevie Nicks, Lana Del Rey & Stevie Nicks]
Blue is the collar of the shirt of the man I love
He's hard at work, hard to the touch
But warm is the body of the girl from the land he loves
My heart is soft, my past is rough

But when I love him, get a feeling
Something close to like a sugar rush
It runs through me, but is it wasted love?

Lyrics:

Uh, what? Starz, Starz
Lana Del Rey, Lana Del Rey
Sing it to me, sing it to me

[Verse 1: Lana Del Rey]
You're so easy to love
You make me cuckoo like a turtle-dove
So hot that I can't get enough, enough of you
Hit me and it felt like a kiss
You know it hurts so good, when you do me like this
So sad when I hear the girls talk
When I walk by, I start to cry-y-y

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey and Starz]
(Sing it to me baby)
'Cause you're a beautiful player
You're a beautiful player, baby
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh oh, baby
(How you love that?)
Ooh ooh oh oh, ah, ah, ah
(Sing it to me, doll)

[Verse 2: Lana Del Rey]
Sunset on a Saturday night
Having a drop-top 'bach ride, time of our lives
He's selling souls on the boulevard of broken dreams
And faded queens
Live young like we oughta die fast
Cause he's been breaking the law and he's not goin' back (goin' back)
I love him violently all through the night
And yes it's true, I live for you-oo-oo

[Chorus - Variation: Lana Del Rey and Starz]

'Cause you're my beautiful player
(Sing it to me)
You're my beautiful player baby
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh oh, baby

[Bridge: Lana Del Rey]
L is for your love that you gave and took away
O is for the only one I wanted to stay
V is for my valiant Valium baby
E is for the X that we took with champagne

[Verse 3: Starz]
I don’t wanna leave, I just wanna breathe
I drive 'em crazy, baby girl, just being me
I’m not selfish, I can’t help it
I was playing the cards I was dealt-ed
The name Starz got a lot of love to give
Riding down Broke Dream Boulevard in the Benz
How you love that? I think too much
A thin line between insanity and true love

[Verse 4: Lana Del Rey]
Hit me and it felt like kiss
Baby if it don't hurt, then I'll have to insist
We have just one life to live
But true love's more than he can give

[Chorus - Variation: Lana Del Rey and Starz]
(Sing it to me baby)
'Cause he’s my beautiful player
He’s my beautiful player, baby
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh oh, baby

Title: Because of You

Lyrics:
[Spoken Intro]
On the streets of LA
Where the future is now
We dance like nobody is watching us
And we live like we want to
But it can also get a little crazy
Unless there's something to hold on to
For me, that was true love

[Verse 1]
I was a young girl, selfish and wild
Like a fire in L.A
Hot like the summer and mean like a child
Who keeps crying 'til she gets her way
(Like a true star)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
There were roses in my hair
Rock and roll on blare and I was in trouble
No one could rock me like you could
I was a bad girl gone good

[Chorus]
Look at me now, I have everything
You gave to me and my heart can sing
I was a kid who could only drink
Dance on tables, making deals with devils
Like a drunk beauty queen
Fighting the fantasy, hooked on the scene
And it brought me to my knees
And it's all because of you
(You know what I'm talkin' about)

[Verse 2]
It was a mad world, we lived for fun
And we got shit for free
Had a face like an angel but inside my heart
Was as black as a broke movie screen
(It was pretty sad)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But then I saw you standing there
Like a millionaire, give me your number
Call me before I get stupid
Make me uncrazy like you did

[Chorus]
Look at me now, I have everything
You gave to me and my heart can sing
I was a kid who could only drink
Dance on tables, making deals with devils
Like a drunk beauty queen
Fighting the fantasy, hooked on the scene
But you brought me to my knees
And it's all because of you

[Bridge]
It isn't hard to see you've got a hold on me
Give me your money, love me to death
Talk like a baby cause I'm so elated
He tell me that I ain't seen nothing quite yet
I don't wanna lose it
I'm in love but I didn't choose it

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Roses in my hair, dancing in the air
Feels like I'm flying
Tell me you love me, boy, do it
It's just like I thought, I just knew it

[Chorus]
Look at me now, I have everything
You gave to me and my heart can sing
I was a kid who could only drink
Dance on tables, making deals with devils
Like a drunk beauty queen
Fighting the fantasy, hooked on the scene
You bring me to my knees
And it's all because of you
Yeah, it's all because of you


Title: Behind Closed Doors

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I like ‘em mad, bad baby, you could be the one
If you wanna get trashed and have fun
Throw me wholly in the sky like a pizza pie (Are you crazy?)
You take my whole world, baby, and twist it to the right
Throw me in the air and whoop like dynamite
Baby you know anytime you can swing by

[Pre-Chorus]
You know I like ‘em bad, boy
Wrong side of the track, boy, oh
You know I like ‘em bad boy, like you
(Like you, you know I do)
I like a man with kick, yeah
So come around and hit me up
No other man can lick me like you
(Like you, you know what you do)

[Chorus]
Everybody’s saying you’re no good for me
But they don’t see the dirty stuff you do to me
Tell me I should leave nearly every day
I’m not gonna do it, baby (no way)
Everybody’s saying you’re no good for me
But they don’t see the dirty stuff you do to me
You only show a little but you give me more
Behind, behind, behind
Behind closed doors
(No one can see us)
(I know you like me)

[Verse 2]
I see my best friends kissing
Touching all the time
But I don’t need no jet to write it in the sky
I see it in his eyes, I’m his cherry pie

[Pre-Chorus]
You know I like ‘em bad, boy
They think you make me sad, boy, no
The best I ever had, boy, it's you
(Like you, you know I do)
I want a man that's hot, yeah
To come around and rock me, yeah
No one can dirty talk me
(Like you, you know what you do)

[Chorus]
Everybody’s saying you’re no good for me
But they don’t see the dirty stuff you do to me
Tell me I should leave nearly every day
I’m not gonna do it, baby (no way)
Everybody’s saying you’re no good for me
But they don’t see the dirty stuff you do to me
You only shout a little but you give me more
Behind, behind, behind
Behind closed doors
Behind closed doors

[Bridge]
Everybody's at the park tonight
Everybody's at the shore
Everybody's on the street tonight
What the hell would we do that for?
Everybody's at the park tonight
But we got fireworks galore, behind closed doors
Behind closed doors

[Chorus]
Everybody’s saying you’re no good for me
But they don’t see the dirty stuff you do to me
Tell me I should leave nearly every day
I’m not gonna do it, baby (no way)
Everybody’s saying you’re no good for me
But they don’t see the dirty stuff you do to me
You only shout a little but you give me more
Behind, behind, behind
Behind closed doors
Behind closed doors
Behind closed doors


Title: Bel Air

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Gargoyles standing at the front of your gate
Trying to tell me to wait, but I can't wait to see you
So I run like I'm mad to heaven's door
I don't wanna be bad, I won't cheat you no more

[Chorus]
Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I've been waiting to meet you
Palm trees in the light, I can see, late at night
Darling, I'm waiting to greet you
Come to me, baby

[Verse 2]
Spotlight, bad baby, you've got a flair
For the violentest kind of love anywhere out there
Mon amour, sweet child of mine, you're divine
Didn't anyone ever tell you it's okay to shine?

[Chorus]
Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I've been waiting to meet you
Palm trees in the light, I can see, late at night
Darling, I'm waiting to greet you
Come to me, baby

[Bridge]
Don't be afraid of me
Don't be ashamed
Walk in the way of my soft resurrection
Idol of roses, iconic soul
I know your name
Lead me to war with your brilliant direction

[Chorus]
Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I've been waiting to meet you
Palm trees in the light, I can see, late at night
Darling, I'm waiting to greet you
Come to me, baby

[Chorus]
Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I've been waiting to meet you
Grenadine, sunshine—can you break this heart of mine?
Darling, I'm waiting to greet you
Come to me, baby


Title: Bellevue

Lyrics:
[Intro]
Before I met you, I had no one
And I could go back to having no one again

[Chorus]
He doesn't want me around, he doesn't want me around
He doesn't want me around, he doesn't want me around
He doesn't want me around

[Verse 1]
Baby, in Bellevue I had no one
And I could go back to being a-lush again
If it would make you proud, if it would make you proud
I know you like to go out and mingle with your friends

[Chorus]
He doesn't want me around, he doesn't want me around
He doesn't want me around

[Verse 2]
And I could change my name, go back to gold lamé
Just like thе good old days, tangos and Tanqueray

[Chorus]
Nothing can hurt me now, nothing can hurt me now
Nothing can hurt mе now, nothing can hurt me

[Bridge]
Now I will wait for you for three hundred years
I play pretend and put my arm around a man who isn't there
I must be insane and now it seems I found
The one to say that I'm scared
Who doesn't want me around

[Chorus]
He doesn't want me around, he doesn't want me around
Ooh, doesn't want me around
He doesn't want me around
He doesn't want me around
Ah, ah

Title: Ben

Lyrics:
[Intro]
Ben's song, another try
Not that you deserve it right now, Ben
No faculties to care and all
But I deserve it, I deserve it, I know
(We can quibble over the history once we make it)
Right?

[Chorus]
Lie down, my sad executive love
Lie down right now
My man bored out of his head right now
Fans turn on a May night
Darkness assumes the room
Lie back, he does in the late night
Hands folded back, certain of doom

[Verse]
Hold me, he sang "Hallelujah"
The midnight's become my noon
You don't know what you do, do ya?
I am on fire for you
I'm on fire, I'm on fire

[Chorus]
Lie down, my sad executive love
Lie down right now
My man bored out of his head right now
Fans turn on a May night
Darkness assumes the room
Hold me, hmm

[Verse]
Hold me, he say "Hallelujah"
The midnight's became my noon
You don't know what you do, do ya?
I am on fire for you
I'm on fire, I'm on fire

[Bridge]
Lie down, my sad executive love
Lie down
I can smoke if I want to
I can dance if I want to
Yeah, it's true that I want you
But don't say you don't want no harm
If you can't understand
'Cause I won't be here long enough for you to be my man

[Outro]
It's not a very nice ending
But that's what you get, just kidding
God Bless America, land that I love
Stand beside her and guide her
I don't know anything, hmm
There you are


Title: Bentley

Lyrics:
He drive up in a summer sky, blue Bentley
Death reflecting in his eyes
Thought about all the women who loved me
I said, "oh no!"
He said, "get inside"
I said, "oh no!"
He said, "get inside"

I got into his summer sky, blue Bentley
Sun reflecting in my eyes
Thought about all the fun I had lately
I said, "Uh huh" I said "I want to drive"
I said, "Uh huh I want, I want to drive"
We drive, We drive

You say you wanna go swimming in my ring
It's green and shimmering
Like my lipstick, the color of dawn
Like my lipstick, the color of dawn
We got out of his summer sky, blue Bentley

Death reflecting in the sky
He held my hand to the ocean he lead me
I said, "uh huh, I want, I want to die"
"Uh huh, I want, I want to die."


Title: Best American Record

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
To the Houses of the Holy
Smokin' on them cigarettes
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
He was cool as heck
He was cool as heck

[Pre-Chorus]
But you were so obsessed
With writing the next best American record
But there was nothing left by the time we got to bed
Baby, that's a shame
You were so obsessed
With writing the next best American record
You did it all for fame
You did it all for fame

[Chorus]
You did it all for fame
Tell me how it treats you now
You did it all for fame
How does that taste coming out?
You did it all for fame
Baby, how's life treating you now?
It's over

[Verse 2]
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
He was 70s in spirit, 90s in his frame of mind
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
We lost track of space
We lost track of time

[Pre-Chorus]
But you were so obsessed
With writing the next best American record
But there was nothing left by the time we got to bed
Baby, that's a shame
You were so obsessed
With writing the next best American record
You did it all for fame
You did it all for fame
(You know what I'm talking about)

[Chorus]
You did it all for fame
Tell me how it treats you now
You did it all for fame
How does that taste coming out?
Now that you lost the game
Honey, how's life treating you now that it's over?
Baby, how you feeling now that I told you?

[Bridge]
It's you
All the roads lead to you
Everything I want and do
All the things that I say
It's true
All the roads lead to you
Like the 405 I drive through
Every night and every day
I see you for who you really are
Why the thousands of girls love
The way Bill plays guitar?

[Chorus]
You did it all for fame
Tell me how it treats you now
You did it all for fame
How does that taste coming out?
You did it all for fame
Honey, how you feeling now?
(How's life treating you now?)
That it's over
Baby, how's life treating you now that I told you?

[Outro]
Honey, how's it feeling now?
(Honey, how's it feeling? Honey, how's it feeling?)
I told you
(Honey, how's it feeling? Honey, how's it feeling?)
I told you

Title: Big Bad Wolf

Lyrics:
[Intro]
I told you not to go into the woods
I told you that he wasn’t any good
I told you not to go into the woods
I told you that he wasn’t any good

[Verse 1]
I’ll take the wrong path
I think I’ll go a little off track
And now there’s no way back
You took all the apples that I had

[Pre-Chorus]
But I heart you and I wanna be your girl
I heart you and I know you’ll rock my world

[Chorus]
‘Cause you rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
You know that I want what you got
You rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
Big bad wolf come on and eat me up, up, up

Big, bad, naughty rock star
Your claws are shinin' bright in the dark
Liftin' up my little red skirt
I know you’ll leave me here in the dirt

[Pre-Chorus]
But I heart you, and I wanna be your girl
I heart you, so come back and rock my world

[Chorus]
‘Cause you rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
You know that I want what you got
You rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
Big bad wolf come on and eat me up, up, up

[Bridge]
Life is like, like a little game
That we like to play, just for fun, just for fun
Yeah, we take nothing seriously, nothing’s wrong, make me run, all night long
Hide and seek is how you play with me
Oh, you’re tempting me, just for fun, just for fun
I hear you calling me over city streets, through the trees, mess with me, then you’ll leave
Oh, be still my heart, escaping in your cherry red car

[Chorus]
‘Cause you rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
You know that I want what you got

Title: Big Eyes

Lyrics:
[Chorus]
With your big eyes
And your big lies
With your big eyes
And your big lies

[Verse 1]
I saw you creeping around the garden; what are you hiding?
I beg your pardon, don't tell me "nothing"
I used to think that I could trust you
I was your woman
You were my knight and shining companion

[Pre-Chorus]
To my surprise
My love's demise
Was his own greed
And lullabies

[Chorus]
With your big eyes
And your big lies
With your big eyes
And your big lies

[Verse 2]
I noticed you got hot in summer
You had no comfort
Your shirt was cotton
Your face was sunburned
You paced around like you'd been waiting
Waiting for something
Your world was burning and I stood watching

[Pre-Chorus]
As I looked on
The flames grew high
You watched me frown
I said "goodbye"

[Chorus]
With your big eyes
And your big lies
With your big eyes
And your big lies

[Bridge]
Is it me, was I wrong to have trusted you?
Did I see what I wanted, what wasn't true?
Was I wrong to go on like a little fool?
It's amazing what women in love will do

[Chorus]
With your big eyes
And your big lies
With your big eyes
And your big lies


Title: Big Spender

Lyrics:
[Intro: Lana Del Rey]
The minute you walked in the joint
I could see you were a man of distinction, a real big spender
Good lookin', so refined
Say, wouldn't you like to know what's goin' on
Big spender

[Verse 1: Smiler]
SM, your boy Smiler iced out
Paid da cost to floss, what's the price now?
Fresh out the gutter, the city begged me to rep it
Cuzzie I came with collateral, getters get me so eff it, I'm a (spender)
I plug money in Harrods
I'm Bugs Bunny with carrots
Diamonds on my neck and my arm blingin' with class
Those that always speculated are now beginning to ask are you a (spender)
If it's mines, what is it?
If it shines, what is it?
If you're coming at me with goods and you're tryna pitch it
I know it's cream of da crop, if it isn't, tell me what is it, I'm a (spender)
Cash rules, my flash jewels are monumental
Brass fools just act cool with what credentials?
It's second nature, I floss and get it for real
Black and yellow diamonds all in my chain, I'm definitely ill

[Hook: Lana Del Rey]
Let me get right to the point
I don't pop my cork for every man I see
Hey big spender
Spend a little time with me

[Verse 2: Smiler]
Spend time or spend paper, Smiler grinds

Title: Bikini Gold

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I couldn't hide my smile from you
As I stopped to breathe exhaust from the tail pipe
Wearing nothing but my cut-off blues
And gold bikini, chain in the moonlight

[Chorus]
You're a nice man
And I am a na-na-na-nasty girl
You're a nice man
And I am a na-na-na-nasty girl

[Verse 2]
I couldn't hide my smile from you
As I watched you struggle out from under
Little hands that cover up your eyes, you tried to drive
But I kicked the steering wheel with my little feet

[Chorus]
You're a nice man
And I am a na-na-na-nasty girl, yeah
You're a nice man
And I am a na-na-na-nasty girl

[Bridge]
Spin me 'round, kiss me in your Chevrolet

Prеtty girls can hoist a bank robbery
'Cause I know I got Jesus watching ovеr me
I love you more than I have ever loved anyone
You know I want to show you
That life can be so much fucking fun
When you're mine, when you're mine
When you're mine, when you're mine

[Verse 3]
I couldn't hide my smile from you
As I watched us sway in between lanes
You know there's no better sight than
A nosedive in the ocean, triple drains

[Chorus]
You're a nice man
And I am a na-na-na-nasty girl
You're a nice man
And I am a na-na-na-nasty girl


Title: Black and White

Lyrics:
He said he wants to leave
Leave me all lonely
I said "That's alright Mr. Man
I didn't wanna be apart of your plan."


Title: Black Bathing Suit

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Grenadine quarantine, I like you a lot
It's L.A., "Hey" on Zoom, Target parking lot
And if this is the end, I want a boyfriend
Someone to eat ice cream with and watch television
Or walk home from the mall with
'Cause what I really meant is when I'm being honest
I'm tired of this shit

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause my body is my temple, my heart is one too
The only thing that still fits me is this black bathing suit
You don't know me any better than they do, baby
My time is run over, so the only time you'll ever see me
Is in your dreams, in my black bathing suit
Lookin' at me lookin' over at you real cute 'cause

[Chorus]
He said I was bad, let me show you how bad girls do
'Cause no one does it better
He said I was bad, let me show you how bad girls do
'Cause no one does it better

[Verse 2]
Swisher Sweet, magazines, promise you it's not
'Cause of you that I'm mean, it's my afterthoughts
And what I never said, why there's a price on my head
It's nothing to do with them, it's my karmic lineage
So I'm not friends with my mother, but I still love my dad
Untraditional lover, can you handle that?

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess I'm complicated, my life's sorta too
I wish you could see to my soul through this black bathing suit
You don't know me any better than they do, baby
'Cause I sing like an angel, my heart's like one too
The only thing that fits is this black bathing suit
Lookin' at me lookin' over at you real cute 'cause

[Chorus]
He said I was bad, let me show you how bad girls do
'Cause no one does it better
He said I was bad, let me show you how bad girls do
'Cause no one does it better
They said I was bad and I'll show them what bad girls do

[Outro]
My black bathing suit
(Oh, let 'em talk about me)
They're just yesterday's news
(They're fucking broke and we're laughin' about them)
Mail me when you get the blues
(We'll have the last laugh about it)
By the way, thanks for the shoes
Your interest really made stacks
Your interest really made stacks
Your interest really made stacks out of it
Your interest really made stacks out of it for me (So thanks for that)
Your interest really made stacks out of it for me (So thanks for that)
Your interest really made stacks out of it for me
So thanks for that


Title: Black Beauty

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I paint my nails black
I dye my hair a darker shade of brown
'Cause you like your women Spanish
Dark, strong and proud
I paint the sky black
You said if you could have your way
You'd make a nighttime all today
So it'd suit the mood of your soul

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, what can I do?
Nothing, my sparrow blue

[Chorus]
Oh, what can I do?
Life is beautiful, but you don't have a clue
Sun and ocean blue
Their magnificence, it don't make sense to you

[Post-Chorus]
Black beauty, ah-ah
Black beauty, ah-ah

[Verse 2]
I paint the house black
My wedding dress black leather, too
You have no room for light
Love is lost on you
I keep my lips red
To seem like cherries in the spring
Darling, you can't let everything
Seem so dark blue

[Pre-Chorus]
But oh, what can I do?
To turn you on or get through you?

[Chorus]
Oh, what can I do?
Life is beautiful, but you don't have a clue
Sun and ocean blue
Their magnificence, it don't make sense to you

[Post-Chorus]
Black beauty, ah-ah
Black beauty, ah-ah

[Bridge]
Black beauty, ah-ah
Black beauty, ah-ah
Black beauty, ah-ah
Black beauty, baby
Black beauty, baby

[Chorus]
Oh, what can I do?
Life is beautiful, but you don't have a clue
Sun and ocean blue
Their magnificence, it don't make sense to you

[Post-Chorus]
Black beauty, ah-ah
Black beauty, ah-ah
Black beauty, ah-ah
Black beauty, ah-ah


Title: Blizzard

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Caught up in a blizzard yesterday
Ought to be alone, or so I say
I needed a change of scenery
She was really starting to annoy me

[Verse 2]
I went out shopping and planned to go to all them vintage stores
Then I got tired and ended up in some lame department store
And that's okay, cause I found a really cool belt and..

[Chorus]
I feel like I'm in high school again
Never knew how much I missed until then
And I'm happy for this day
No matter what you say
I don't have to be sad like you

[Verse 3]
I have a commitment Friday night
First I say my prayer then I'm alright
I sit in my chair, you dim the light
When I look I stare with inner sight

[Chorus]
I feel like I'm in high school again
Never knew how much I missed until then
And I'm happy for this day
No matter what you say
I don't have to be sad like you

[Bridge]
Met up with some friends for Thai food
I liked it but wasn't in the mood
Can't you see that I'm just feeling blue?
What I do’s got nothing to do with you

[Chorus]
I feel like I'm in high school again
Never knew how much I missed until then
And I'm happy for this day
No matter what you say
I don't have to be sad like you


Title: Blue Banisters

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
There's a picture on the wall
Of me on a John Deere
Jenny handed me a beer
Said, "How the hell did you get there?"
Oh, Oklahoma
Mm-mm, mm

[Verse 2]
There were flowers that were dry
Sittin' on the dresser
She asked me where they're from
I said, "A place I don't remember"
Oh, Oklahoma (Oh-oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Jenny jumped into the pool
She was swimmin' with Nikki Lane
She said, "Most men don't want a woman
With a legacy, it's our bane"
She said "You can't be a muse and be happy too
You can't blacken the pages with Russian poetry
And be happy"
And that scared me
'Cause I met a man who

[Chorus]
Said he'd come back every May
Just to help me if I'd paint my banisters blue
Blue banisters, ooh
Said he'd fix my weathervane
Give me children, take away my pain
And paint my banisters blue
My banisters blue

[Verse 3]
There's a hole that's in my heart
All my women try and heal
They're doin' a good job
Convincin' me that it's not real
It's heat lightning, oh-oh-oh, oh

[Verse 4]
'Cause there's a man that's in my past
There's a man that's still right here
He's real enough to touch
And in my darkest nights, he's shinin'
Ooh-ooh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
Jenny was smokin' by the pool
We were writin' with Nikki Lane
I said I'm scared of the Santa Clarita Fires
I wish that it would rain
I said the power of us three can bring absolutely anything
Except that one thing
The diamonds, the rust, and the rain
The thing that washes away the pain
But that's okay, 'cause

[Chorus]
Now when weather turns to May
All my sisters come to paint my banisters green
My blue banisters gray
Tex and Mex are in the Bay
Chucky's makin' birthday cake
Chickens runnin' bare feet, there's a baby on the way
And now my blue banisters are green and gray, ah-ah

[Outro]
Summer comes, winter goes
Spring, I skip, God knows
Summer comes, winter goes
Spring, I sleep, Heaven knows
Every time it turns to May
All my sisters fly to me
To paint, paint


Title: Blue Jeans

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Blue jeans, white shirt
Walked into the room, you know you made my eyes burn
It was like James Dean for sure
You're so fresh to death and sick as ca-cancer
You were sorta punk rock, I grew up on hip-hop
But you fit me better than my favorite sweater
And I know that love is mean (Oh-oh) and love hurts (Oh-oh)
But I still remember that day we met in December, oh, baby

[Chorus]
I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember (Oh, baby)
Say you'll remember (Oh, baby)
Ooh, I will love you 'til the end of time

[Verse 2]
Big dreams, gangsta
Said you had to leave to start your life over
I was like, "No, please, stay here
We don't need no money, we could make it all work"
But he headed out on Sunday, said he'd come home Monday
I stayed up waiting, anticipatin' and pacing
But he was chasin' (Oh-oh) paper (Oh-oh)
Caught up in the game, that was the last I heard

[Chorus]
I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember (Oh, baby)
Say you'll remember (Oh, baby)
Ooh, I will love you 'til the end of time

[Bridge]
You went out every night and, baby, that's alright
I told you that, no matter what you did, I'd be by your side
'Cause I'm a ride or die whether you fail or fly
Well, shit, at least you tried
But when you walked out that door, a piece of me died
Told you I wanted more, that's not what I had in mind
I just want it like before, we were dancin' all night
Then they took you away, stole you out of my life
You just need to remember

[Chorus]
I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember (Oh, baby)
Say you'll remember (Oh, baby)
Ooh, I will love you 'til the end of time


Title: Blue Madonna

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: BØRNS, Lana Del Rey, Both]
Ayy, ayy
Someone must have sent me to heaven
Blue Madonna down by the pool (Ah)
Just want to make her feel like a virgin
A version of herself that she once knew (Ooh)

[Verse 2: BØRNS]
But I just wanna watch her
Like a candle in the moonlight
Hotter than a blueberry flame
What's her name?
Smoke rising in the distance
She glides in a swan dive
Cooler than a strawberry shake

[Verse 3: BØRNS, Lana Del Rey, Both]
All the rivers run back into the sea (Baby, baby)
But baby don’t you leave (Baby, don't you leave)
I only want you running back to me

[Outro: Lana Del Rey]
Blue Madonna in my bed now
Blue Madonna in my head now
Blue Madonna cherry red now
In this light
Blue Madonna in my bed now
Blue Madonna in my head now
Blue Madonna cherry red now
Tonight, tonight


Title: Blue Skies

Lyrics:
[Chorus]
Blue skies smiling at me
Nothing but blue skies do I see
Bluebirds singing a song
Nothing but bluebirds all day long

[Pre-Chorus]
Never saw the sun shining so bright
Never saw things going so right
Noticing the days hurrying by
When you're in love, my, how they fly

[Chorus]
Blue days, all of them gone
Nothing but blue skies from now on

[Pre-Chorus]
Never saw the sun shining so bright
Never saw things going so right
Noticing the days hurrying by
When you're in love, my, how they fly

[Chorus]
Blue days, all of them gone
Nothing but blue skies from now on
(From now on)

[Outro]
From now on
From now on
Da-da, da-da-da-da, da, da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da-da, da, da-da
Da-da, da-da, da-da
Da-da, oh
Oh, ah


Title: Blue Velvet

Lyrics:
[Intro]
Mmm

[Verse 1]
She wore blue velvet
Bluer than velvet was the night
Softer than satin was the light
From the stars

[Verse 2]
She wore blue velvet
Bluer than velvet were her eyes
Warmer than May, her tender sighs
Love was ours

[Bridge]
Ours a love I held tightly
Feeling the rapture grow
Like a flame burning brightly
But when she left, gone was the glow of

[Verse 3]
Blue velvet
But in my heart there'll always be
Precious and warm a memory
Through the years

[Outro]
And I still can see blue velvet through my tears

Lyrics:
[Chorus]
Everyone from home
Says that you're so cool
Come on, everybody
To the boarding school
Everyone from town
Says that you're so cool
Come on, get down
To the boarding school

[Verse 1]
L-L-Let's do drugs
Make love with our teachers
Come on, date a townie

If you wanna get high with me
I'm in the back doin' crack, drinkin' p-p-pepsi

But she got a great ass and she knows how to show it
With American flags on each little finger
You're crashing on Wall Street
While I'm blowing up as a singer

If you wanna get that scholarship
Yale's not a problem, let's solve it
Educated in the language of doin' it
Get down like your tutor taught you to
And do it

Come on, everybody
To the boarding school
Everyone from town
Says that you're so cool
Come on, get down

If you wanna be that pin-up queen
You can, you can
If you wanna do that south beach swing
Or go on a groove, vacationing
You can, you can, you can

[Bridge]
When they said prolific, they weren't kidding
You thought that I was just a calender kitten
But now you heard me purring, tiger, you're smitten
So let's begin to major in the art of sinnin'

[Chorus]
Everyone from home
Says that you're so cool
Come on, everybody
To the boarding school
Everyone from town
Says that you're so cool
Come on, get down
To the boarding school

Get down, get down

Elvis is my daddy
Marilyn's my mother
Jesus is my bestest friend
We don't need nobody
'Cause we got each other
Or at least I pretend

Dancing and grinding in the pale moonlight

Sing that body electric

Heaven is my baby
Suicide's her father
Opulence is the end

Dancing and grinding in the pale moonlight
Grand Ole Opry
We're feeling alright
Mary prays the rosary for my broken mind

Sing that body electric

My clothes still smell like you
And all the photographs say you're still young
I pretend I'm not hurt
And go about the world like I'm having fun

We get crazy every Friday night
Drop it like it's hot in the pale moonlight
Grand Ole Opry
Feeling alright
Mary swaying softly to her heart's delight

I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric
Sing that body electric
Sing that body electric
I'm on fire

Title: Bollywood Hawaii

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Everytime you walk out on me
I regress back to the one that I can't see
He's someone I have never talked about
Cause I know that we'd both be dead if you found out
Everytime you tell me that I'm wrong
I just can't remember how to play along
There's something I have never told you
I'm not really from this world
There's something that I've been witholding
I'm not like every other girl

[Chorus]
Loha, loha, maihi, maihi, yoha, yoho
Loha, loha, maihi, maihi, yoha, yoho
You are the one in my dreams that I've waited for
You are the one in my dreams that I've waited for

[Verse 2]
So if you begin to think that
My light might be supernatural
I'd have to say you're right
"You're right, mon cher, it is"
I came from a place that your mind can not even imagine
We say "Maha, mahaha, mahaha, maha"
And we sing

[Chorus]
Loha, loha, maihi, maihi, yoha, yoho
Loha, loha, maihi, maihi, yoha, yoho
You are the one in my dreams that I've waited for
You are the one in my dreams that I've waited for

[Outro]
I need your love babe
I need your loving
I need your love babe
I need your loving

Title: Born Bad Baby

Lyrics:
I was born bad
But then I met you
You made me nice for a while
But my dark side's true
You never cared what I did at all
Motel singer or the silver pole
I did what I had to do
Femme fatale always on the run
Diamonds on my neck, whiskey on my tongue
Before I get back I gotta get drunk
So get over here pour me a cold one
Babe he can see that I'm danger
Teetering off of the stage yeah
Sparkling in sequins say hey-yeah
Time to give in to the kindness of strangers
Is it wro-wrong that I think it's kind of fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back but I'm flat out of luck
Is it wro-wrong that I think it's kind of fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun
Now daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back but I'm kinda outta luck

Wrong, I know, killing someone
Gets a little easier after done it once
You know that I'm fine, you know that I'm young
So tell me you're mine, let's get it on

Babe he can see that I'm danger
Glamorous but I'm deranged, yeah
Dancing on top of the tables
I said it really nice, hey, can you be my saviour?

Is it wro-wrong that I think it's kind of fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back but I'm flat out of luck
Is it wro-wrong that I think it's kind of fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun
Now daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back but I'm kinda outta luck

I love you, my little darling
You, my little darling
You, my little darling
You, my little darling

Dancing on top of the tables
Stronger, I wish I was able
Some [?] but I'm not capable
I gotta get you back, cause I gotta live [?]

Is it wro-wrong that I think it's kind of fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back but I'm flat out of luck
Is it wro-wrong that I think it's kind of fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back but I'm kinda outta luck


Title: Born to Die

Lyrics:
Feet don't fail me now
Take me to the finish line
Oh my heart it breaks every step that I take
But I'm hoping that the gates
They'll tell me that you're mine

Walking through the city streets
Is it by mistake or design?
I feel so alone on a Friday night
Can you make it feel like home
If I tell you you're mine?
It's like I told you, honey

Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough
I don't know why
Keep making me laugh, let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

Come take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
Choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die

Lost but now I am found
I can see but once I was blind
I was so confused as a little child
Tried to make what I could get
Scared that I couldn't find
All the answers, honey

Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough
I don't know why
Keep making me laugh, let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

Come take a walk on the wild side
Come kiss me hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
Choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die

We were born to die
We were born

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
Choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die


Title: Born To Die

Lyrics:
Feet don't fail me now
Take me to the finish line
All my heart, it breaks every step that I take
But I'm hoping that the gates
They'll tell me that you're mine
Walking through the city streets
Is it by mistake or design?
I feel so alone on a Friday night
Can you make it feel like home, if I tell you you're mine
It's like I told you honey

Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough
I don't know why
Keep making me laugh
Let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
Choose your last words
This is the last time
Cause you and I, we were born to die

Lost but now I am found
I can see but once I was blind
I was so confused as a little child
Tried to take what I could get
Scared that I couldn't find
All the answers, honey

Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough
I don't know why
Keep making me laugh
Let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
Choose your last words
This is the last time
Cause you and I
We were born to die
We were born to die
We were born to die

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane

Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough
I don't know why
Keep making me laugh
Let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
Choose your last words
This is the last time
Cause You and I
We were born to die
We were born to die

Title: Bread and Oranges

Lyrics:
[Intro]
Well, I didn't know it would come to this
But that's what happens when you're on your own
And you're all right with letting nice things go

[Verse 1]
Well, I pawned the earrings that you gave me
Gold and made of flowers dangling
And I almost cried as I sold them all
And I don't mind living on bread and oranges, oh, oh
But I gotta get to and from where I come
And it's gonna take money to go

[Chorus]
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh

[Verse 2]
In the name of higher consciousness
I let the best man I know go
'Cause it's nice to love and be loved
But it's better to know all you can know
Yeah, it's nice to love and be loved
But I'd rather know what God knows

[Chorus]
Oh no, oh no, oh no, no, no no, oh

[Outro]
Well, I didn't know it would come to this
But that's what happens when you're on your own
And you're all right with letting nice things go

Title: Breaking Up Slowly

Lyrics:
[Chorus: Nikki Lane]
Breakin' up slowly is a hard thing to do
I love you only, but it's makin' me blue
So don't send me flowers like you always do
It's hard to be lonely, but it's the right thing

[Verse 1: Nikki Lane]
Are these my good years or do I have none?
Are there really good years for everyone?
I don't wanna live with a life of regret
I don't wanna end up like Tammy Wynette

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey & Nikki Lane]
'Cause breakin' up slowly is a hard thing to do
I love you only, but it's makin' me blue
So don't send me flowers like you always do
It's hard to bе lonely, but it's the right thing to do

[Verse 2: Lana Del Rey]
Georgе got arrested out on the lawn
We might be breakin' up after this song
Will he still love me long after I'm gone?
Or did he see it comin' all along?

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey & Nikki Lane]
'Cause breakin' up slowly is a hard thing to do
I love you only, and it's makin' me blue
So don't send me flowers like you always do
It's hard to be lonely (Baby, breakin' up is hard to do)
Breakin' up slowly (Baby, breakin' up is hard to do)
Breakin' up slowly is a hard thing to do
I love you only, and it's makin' me blue
So don't send me flowers like you always do
It's hard to be lonely, but it's the right thing to do


Title: Break My Fall

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
The greatest line in history:
Baby it’s not you, it’s me
What you think I’m dumb, dumb, babydoll?
I’m big enough and bad enough
And I can tell when things get rough
Now nothing that you say can break my fall

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh
Stop right there
Oh, oh
If you really care

[Chorus]
Don’t go and blow it all, it’s bad enough baby
I don’t wanna hear you sayin' it’s not you, it’s me
If there’s blood on my hands, you should let me know
If you’re done with the dance, you should let me go
Baby you said it all
There’s nothing you can say to break my fall

[Verse 2]
The greatest line in history:
Baby it’s not you, it’s me
Do you really think I'll buy that story, boy?
Ooh-oh-oh-oh
Give a girl her self respect
You haven’t gone and hurt me yet
But you know that I’ll crumble if you call

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh
Stop right there
Oh, oh
If you really care

[Chorus]
Don’t go and blow it all, it’s bad enough baby
I don’t wanna hear you sayin' it’s not you, it’s me
If there’s blood on my hands, you should let me know
If you’re done with the dance, you should let me go
Baby you said it all
There’s nothing you can say to break my fall

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
I’m not gonna let you become a martyr
Not gonna let you pick up the gun
I’m gonna make this a whole lot harder
Won’t make it easy for you to run
I'm not gonna let you declare surrender
Not gonna let you pick up the gun
I'll give you a goodbye that you'll remember
Won’t make it easy for you to run

[Chorus]
Don’t go and blow it all, it’s bad enough baby
I don’t wanna hear you sayin' it’s not you, it’s me
If there’s blood on my hands, you should let me know
If you’re done with the dance, you should let me go
Baby you said it all
There’s nothing you can say to break my fall
Don’t go and blow it all, it’s bad enough baby
I don’t wanna hear you sayin' it’s not you, it’s me
If there’s blood on my hands, you should let me know
If you’re done with the dance, you should let me go
Baby you said it all
There’s nothing you can say to break my fall
Don’t go and blow it all, it’s bad enough baby
I don’t wanna hear you sayin' it’s not you, it’s me
If there’s blood on my hands, you should let me know
If you’re done with the dance, you should let me go
Baby you said it all
There’s nothing you can say to break my fall

Title: Brooklyn Baby

Lyrics:
[Intro]
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da

[Verse 1]
They say I'm too young to love you
I don't know what I need
They think I don't understand
The freedom land of the seventies
I think I'm too cool to know ya
You say I'm like the ice, I freeze
I'm churning out novels like
Beat poetry on amphetamines

[Pre-Chorus]
I say
I say

[Chorus]
Well, my boyfriend's in a band
He plays guitar while I sing Lou Reed
I've got feathers in my hair
I get down to Beat poetry
And my jazz collection's rare
I can play most anything
I'm a Brooklyn baby
I'm a Brooklyn baby

[Post-Chorus]
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-ya-da
Pa-da-da-da-da-da-da

[Verse 2]
They say I'm too young to love you
They say I'm too dumb to see
They judge me like a picture book
By the colors, like they forgot to read
I think we're like fire and water
I think we're like the wind and sea
You're burning up, I'm cooling down
You're up, I'm down
You're blind, I see

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm free, ooh
I'm free

[Chorus]
Well, my boyfriend's in a band
He plays guitar while I sing Lou Reed
I've got feathers in my hair
I get down to Beat poetry
And my jazz collection's rare
I can play most anything
I'm a Brooklyn baby
I'm a Brooklyn baby

[Bridge]
I'm talking 'bout my generation
I'm talking 'bout my newer nation
And if you don't like it, you can beat it
Beat it, baby
You never liked the way I said it
If you don't get it, then forget
'Cause I don't have to fucking explain it

[Chorus]
And my boyfriend's in a band
He plays guitar while I sing Lou Reed
I've got feathers in my hair
I get high on hydroponic weed
And my jazz collection's rare
I get down to Beat poetry
I'm a Brooklyn baby
I'm a Brooklyn baby

[Post-Chorus]
Pa-da-pa-pa, pa-de-da
Te-de-de, da-da-ah
Ooh, oh, woah-ah

[Chorus]
Yeah, my boyfriend's pretty cool
But he's not as cool as me
'Cause I'm a Brooklyn baby
I'm a Brooklyn baby

[Outro]
Pa-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da, baby
Ah-ta-da-da-da-da

Yeah, yeah

Title: Buddy’s Rendezvous

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Lana Del Rey]
Everybody's girl
What’s the point in bein' everybody's girl?
Maybe you think that way there’s no chance gettin' hurt
Livin' for no one costs me way more than it's worth

[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
So you're gonna be a singer
Well, I'll be, goddamn
You're as pretty as a post card
No thanks to the old man
It's the same coat I had on
The night that I went in
I can stay an hour at Canter’s
The streets cool off by then
When can I see you again?

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
Whatever happened to the girl I knew?
In the wasteland, come up short and end up on the news
Whatever happened to the girl I knew?
In the wasteland, come up short and end up on the news
Hey, hey, hey, hey

[Verse 2: Lana Del Rey]
Everything you want
What’s the fun in gettin' everything you want?
I wouldn’t know, but look, baby, you should try
Forget that lefty shit your mom drilled in your mind

[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
Give the world a new savior
Sell his pictures to the press
Buy a place out in the country
Leave this world for someone else
My destruction is an hour late
I'm at Buddy's Rendezvous
Tellin' the losers and old timers
How good I did with you
They almost believe me, too

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey, Lana Del Rey & Father John Misty]
Whatever happened to the girl I knew?
In the wasteland, come up short and end up on the news
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Whatever happened to the girl I knew?
In the wasteland, come up short and end up on the news
Ah-ha, ah-ha
Whatever happened to the girl I knew?
In the wasteland, come up short and end up on the news
Hey, hey, hey, hey

[Outro: Lana Del Rey & Father John Misty]
Whatever happened?
Whatever happened?


Title: Burning Desire

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Every Saturday night, I get dressed up to ride for you, baby
Cruising down the street on Hollywood and Vine for you, baby
I drive fast, wind in my hair
I push it to the limits 'cause I just don't care
You ask me where I've been; I been everywhere
But I don't want to be nowhere but here
(Come on, tell me, boy)

[Chorus]
I've got a burning desire for you, baby
(I've got a burning desire) (Come on, tell me, boy)
I've got a burning desire for you, baby
(I've got a burning desire) (Come on, tell me, boy)
I drive fast, wind in my hair
I push it to the limits 'cause I just don't care (Don't care)
I've got a burning desire for you, baby
(I've got a burning desire)

[Verse 2]
Every Saturday night I seem to come alive for you, baby
Santa Monica, I'm racing in the lights for you, baby
I drive fast, radio blares
Have to touch myself to pretend you're there
Your hands were on my hips, your name was on my lips
Over, over again like my only prayer
(Come on, tell me, boy)

[Chorus]
I've got a burning desire for you, baby
(I've got a burning desire) (Come on, tell me, boy)
I've got a burning desire for you, baby
(I've got a burning desire) (Come on, tell me, boy)
I drive fast, wind in my hair
I push it to the limits 'cause I just don't care (Don't care)
I've got a burning desire for you, baby
(I've got a burning desire)

[Bridge]
I'm driving fast, flash!
Everyone knows it
I'm trying to get to you, baby
I'm feeling scared and you know it
I'm driving fast, flash!
Everyone knows it
I'm trying to get to you, baby
I'm feeling scared and you know it

I'm driving fast, flash!
Everyone knows it
I'm trying to get to you, baby
I'm feeling scared and you know it
I'm driving fast, flash!
Everyone knows it
I'm trying to get to you, baby
I'm feeling scared and you know it
Ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
I've got a burning desire for you, baby
(I've got a burning desire) (Come on, tell me, boy)
I've got a burning desire for you, baby
(I've got a burning desire) (Come on, tell me, boy)
I drive fast, wind in my hair
I push it to the limits 'cause I just don't care (Don't care)
I've got a burning desire for you, baby
(I've got a burning desire)


Title: Burnt Norton (Interlude)

Lyrics:
[Interlude]
Time present and time past
Are both perhaps present in time future
And time future contained in time past
If all time is eternally present
All time is unredeemable
What might have been is an abstraction
Remaining a perpetual possibility
Only in a world of speculation
What might have been and what has been
Point to one end, which is always present
Footfalls echo in the memory
Down the passage which we did not take
Towards the door we never opened
Into the rose-garden


Title: Butterflies

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
We’re sippin' cocktails, lookin' down upon the riot
You whisper “Baby, love the way you look tonight
I wanna save you, save you from the world outside."
I know it seems you’re all I wanted and much more
But then, to tell the truth, I’ve been through this before
They say “I’ll save you, save you”, but they never do
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I think you know I want to believe you
But in my heart, I know that I’ll leave you
It’s sort of sad how instincts deceive you, or does it please you?
Everything you say makes me wanna stay
But everything you've done makes me wanna run, run

[Chorus]
I made the decision that I can’t be with you
Walkin' out the door but I already miss you
Thinkin' about how I used to kiss you
I-I’m getting butterflies, I-I’m getting butterflies
I make the decision that I’m too good for you
Then I see you're callin', it’s hard to ignore you
Try to be strong, but babe, I adore you
I-I’m getting butterflies, I-I’m getting butterflies

[Verse 2]
Well back in high school, in the yard, we used to fight
But you would sneak in through my window every night
“I wanna take you, take you to the world outside”
Well, I assume it’s what I wanted at the time (oh, at the time)
But your eyes were like a constant warning sign (oh, warning sign)
“I wanna take you, take you” and I didn’t mind

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And even then I didn’t believe you (no)
You had a smile so easy to see through
I know a little part of me will always need you (yes)
Try to reach you, try to please you (what?)
Everything you say makes me wanna stay
But everything you done makes me wanna run, run

[Chorus]
I made the decision that I can’t be with you
Walkin' out the door but I already miss you
Thinkin' about how I used to kiss you
I-I’m getting butterflies, I-I’m getting butterflies
I make the decision that I’m too good for you
Then I see you're callin', it’s hard to ignore you
Try to be strong, but babe, I adore you
I-I’m getting butterflies, I-I’m getting butterflies

[Bridge]
I know, I know, I know, we aren't good together
I can’t let go, I’m sure that we should be forever

[Pre-Chorus 3]
I look around, there’s no one above you
I think you know that I’ll always love you
And baby, I’m bad too, it’s not just you
But I can’t wait forever to trust you
Everything you say makes me wanna stay
But everything you’ve done makes me wanna run, run

[Chorus]
I made the decision that I can’t be with you
Walkin' out the door but I already miss you
Thinkin' about how I used to kiss you
I-I’m getting butterflies, I-I’m getting butterflies
I make the decision that I’m too good for you
Then I see you're callin', it’s hard to ignore you
Try to be strong, but babe, I adore you
I-I’m getting butterflies, I-I’m getting butterflies


Title: Butterflies, Pt. 2

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
You're hot for God, but we all got a hunch that
Maybe you've gone astray
Control yourself, but it's so hard
When you can look so good on Sunday
I know he knows that I knew what he's thinking
I know he knows
I know he knows that what he's doing is wrong
But I just tell him "Go on, sing a sad song."

[Pre-Chorus]
My baby has an eye for pretty things, pretty things
He thinks that little girls are butterflies and clips their wings
Sicko, psycho, sicko, but he's my beau
Puts them on a roller coaster, lures them in with Coca-Cola!

[Chorus]
Boy, you've been catching butterflies
All the girls believe your lies, don't they?
Boy, you can pin me up if you like
A pin-up in a lonely sky, baby
You give me butterflies
You're catchin' butterflies
You give me butterflies, I'm fluttering, fluttering high

[Verse 2]
You're hot to trot, but boy, you got a
Secret that you cannot betray
He likes it hot, you're burning up
But baby boy, your secret is safe
I know he know that I knew what he's thinking
I know he know
I know he know that what he's teaching is wrong
But, honey, this preacher's song has got me too far gone

[Pre-Chorus]
My baby has an eye for girls who sing, girls who sing
He's lucky I'm the type, that's his thing, that's his thing
Sicko, psycho, sicko, but he's my beau
Dresses up in rings and rollers, poses as a Holy Roller!

[Chorus]
Boy, you've been catching butterflies
All the girls believe your lies, don't they?
Boy, you can pin me up if you like
A pin-up in a lonely sky, baby
You give me butterflies
You're catchin' butterflies
You give me butterflies, I'm fluttering, fluttering high

[Bridge]
His butterflies are in a golden cage, safe and bound
He puts on "Lola" by The Kinks and he dances 'round
And he's so happy that his feet don't even touch the ground
And I'm in love cause I was lost and now I'm finally found

[Chorus]
Boy, you've been catching butterflies
All the girls believe your lies, don't they?
Boy, you can pin me up if you like
A pin-up in a lonely sky, baby
You give me butterflies
You're catchin' butterflies
You give me butterflies, I'm fluttering, fluttering

[Outro]
Fluttering, fluttering
Fluttering, fluttering
Fluttering
(Psycho, sicko, psycho)


Title: Cactus

Lyrics:
Note: The following are the lyrics of the original song
Lana's version might differ (if it ever resurfaces)

[Verse 1]
Sitting here wishing on a cement floor
Just wishing that I had just something you wore
I put it on when I grow lonely
Will you take off your dress and send it to me?

[Verse 2]
I miss your kiss and then I miss your head
And a letter in your writing doesn't mean you're not dead
Run outside in the desert heat
Make your dress all wet then send it to me

[Verse 3]
I miss your soup and I miss your brеad
And a letter in your writing doesn't mеan you're not dead
So spill your breakfast and drip your wine
Just wear that dress when you dine

[Interlude]
P-I-X-I-E-S

[Verse 4]
Sitting here wishing on a cement floor
Just wishing that I had just something you wore
Bloody your hands on a cactus tree
Wipe it on your dress and send it to me

[Verse 5]
Sitting here wishing on a cement floor
Just wishing that I had just something you wore


Title: California

Lyrics:
[Intro]
(One, two, three, four)

[Verse 1]
You don't ever have to be stronger than you really are
When you're lying in my arms, baby
You don't ever have to go faster than your fastest pace
Or faster than my fastest cars

[Pre-Chorus]
I shouldn't have done it, but I read it in your letter
You said to a friend that you wish you were doing better
I wanted to reach out, but I never said a thing
I shouldn't have done it, but I read it in your letter
You said to a friend that you wish you were doing better
I wanted to call you, but I didn't say a thing
(Two, three, four)

[Chorus]
Oh, I'll pick you up
If you come back to America, just hit me up
'Cause this is crazy love, I'll catch you on the flip side
If you come back to California, you should just hit me up
We'll do whatever you want, travel wherever how far
We'll hit up all the old places
We'll have a party, we'll dance 'til dawn
I'll pick up all of your Vogues and all of your Rolling Stones
Your favorite liquor off the top shelf
I'll throw a party all night long

[Verse 2]
You don't ever have to be stronger than you really are
When you're lying in my arms, and, honey
You don't ever have to act cooler than you think you should
You're brighter than the brightest stars

[Pre-Chorus]
You're scared to win, scared to lose
I've heard the war was over if you really choose
The one in and around you
You hate the heat, you got the blues
Changing like the weather, oh, that's so like you
The Santa Ana moves you
(Two, three, four)

[Chorus]
Oh, I'll pick you up
If you come back to America, just hit me up
'Cause this is crazy love, I'll catch you on the flip side
If you come back to California, you should just hit me up
We'll do whatever you want, travel wherever how far
We'll hit up all the old places
We'll have a party, we'll dance 'til dawn
I'll pick up all of your Vogues and all of your Rolling Stones
Your favorite liquor off the top shelf
I'll throw a party all night long

[Outro]
Oh, I'll pick you up
If you come back to America, just hit me up
'Cause this is crazy love, I'll catch you on the flip side
If you come back to California, you should just hit me up


Title: Calm

Lyrics:
None


Title: Calm The Fire

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Calm the fire, do not fight anymore
They don’t know what they’re saying, they don’t know anything at all
For all that matters is you know that this is not their fault

All the places we should never go
Lost between the cracks something wicked waits below
And all I’m saying there are some things better left unseen at all

[Quote: Furry Vengeance]
Dan Screaming

[Verse 2]
It’s been so long it’s tearing me apart
I cannot understand or comprehend
Where we went wrong. Now we’ve come so far
The madness in our hearts will nеver end

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Cause I’vе seen it all
I can’t fight it anymore
If I had burned forevermore
Is there nothing left to save?

[Chorus]
Cause now more than ever what we need
Is love to replace all the obscene
Something good and something beautiful, if only we could see
That now more than ever what we need
Is a little love

[Verse 3]
Is there no more have we gone too far?
There’s nothing I can do to make you sway
To see the blood running through our hearts
No different from the blood we’ve come to hate

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When I close my eyes
I dream that we are colorblind
And now you know you can’t deny
Only ignorance to blame

[Chorus]
Cause now more than ever what we need
Is love to replace all the obscene
Something good and something beautiful, if only we could see
That now more than ever what we need
Is a little love

[Bridge]
Now let it calm the fire
That burns within your heart tonight
For some are too blind to see
The world as it’s meant to be

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When I close my eyes
I dream that we are colorblind
And now you know you can’t deny
Only ignorance to blame

[Chorus]
Cause now more than ever what we need
Is love to replace all the obscene
Something good and something beautiful, if only we could see
That now more than ever what we need
Is a little love


Title: Candy Necklace

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Lana Del Rey]
White fire, cinnamon on my teeth
And I'm sittin' at the stoplight northern town
I feel lucky
I drive somewhere out of range, I don't know where
White noise comin' all in my brain
Turns off for nothing

[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
Rockafella, my umbrella
God, I love you, baby
Storyteller, us forever
Is my favorite song

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
You've been actin' pretty restless
Dancin' like the young and restless
And I'm obsessed with it
Candy necklaces
You've been actin' pretty reckless
Dancin' like the young and restless
And I'm obsessеd with this
All his candy necklaces

[Verse 2: Lana Del Rey]
Sittin' on the sofa, feelin' supеr suicidal
Hate to say the word, but, baby, hand on the Bible, I do
Feel like it's you, the one who's bringin' me down
Thought that we were cool and we were kickin' it like Tribe Called Quest
You the best, but, baby, you've been bringin' me down
I can see it now

[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
Rockafella, my umbrella
God, I love you, baby
Fortune teller, favorite ever
That's the story of us

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
You've been actin' pretty restless
Dancin' like the young and reckless
And I'm obsessed with this
Candy necklaces
I think that we should address this
Actin' like the young and restless
I'm obsessed with this
All his candy necklaces

[Piano Solo]

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
We've been actin' pretty restless
Dancin' like the young and restless
I'm obsessed with this
Candy necklaces

[Outro: Jon Batiste, Lana Del Rey & Jon Batiste, Lana Del Rey]
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces (Mm)
Candy necklaces (Mm, hmm)
Candy necklaces (I'm obsessed with this)
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces ('Cause I'm obsessed with this)
Candy necklaces (Mm)
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces, oh


Title: Carmen

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Darlin', darlin' doesn't have a problem
Lyin' to herself 'cause her liquor's top shelf
It's alarming, honestly, how charming she can be
Fooling everyone, telling 'em she's having fun

[Pre-Chorus]
She says, "You don't wanna be like me
Don't wanna see all the things I've seen
I'm dyin', I'm dyin'"
She says, "You don't wanna get this way
Famous and dumb at an early age
Lyin', I'm lyin"

[Chorus]
The boys, the girls, they all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God, her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies, she's still shinin'
Like lightning, oh-oh
Like lightning

[Verse 2]
Carmen, Carmen, stayin' up 'til morning
Only seventeen, but she walks the streets so mean
It's alarming, truly, how disarmin' you can be
Eatin' soft ice cream, Coney Island queen

[Pre-Chorus]
She says, "You don't wanna be like me
Lookin' for fun, gettin' high for free
I'm dyin', I'm dyin'"
She says, "You don't wanna get this way
Street walk at night and a star by day
It's tirin', tirin'"

[Chorus]
The boys, the girls, they all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God, her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies, she's still shinin'
Like lightning, oh-oh
Like lightning

[Bridge]
Baby's all dressed up with nowhere to go
That's the little story of the girl you know
Relyin' on the kindness of strangers
Tyin' cherry knots, smilin', doin' party favors
Put your red dress on, put your lipstick on
Sing your song, song, now the camera's on
And you're alive again

[Interlude]
Mon amour, je sais que tu m'aimes aussi
Tu as besoin de moi, tu as besoin de moi dans ta vie
Tu ne peux vivre sans moi
Et je mourrais sans toi
Je tuerais pour toi

[Chorus]
The boys, the girls, they all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God, her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies, she's still shinin'
Like lightning, oh-oh
Like lightning
Like lightning, oh-oh
Like lightning

[Outro]
Darlin', darlin' doesn't have a problem
Lyin' to herself 'cause her liquor's top shelf

Title: Catch and Release

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
So, I heard you wanna go to Rio, baby
Yes, I seen page six lately, ah
I told you both them broads was crazy
Hackin' in your phone and shit
Diamonds and pearls, your little girl
She got the best, sparklin' like a Hollywood movie, ah-ah-ah

[Verse 2]
If you got the cash, lock it down tight
I got the looks, you got my heart right
And you love me, 'cause I'm just like neon
Lightin' up your night

[Chorus]
Give it to me, give it to me, everything
You know how I like my world on a string
I didn't want nothin' from you
Just to be like you, my king

[Verse 3]
I thought that you wanted a real girl, baby
You lured me in with all your gold
Catch and release, and you're so cold
Are you crazy?
You didn't know what kinda fish you caught
'Cause I am a shark, beware of my bark
I'll eat you up like the center of a tootsie pop

[Verse 4]
'Cause we were a match in heaven, high
Only one catch, Frank was the boss, right?
And it's so sad, 'cause the only way
That you know how to love is fight

[Chorus]
Give it to me, give it to me, everything
You know how I like my world on a string
I didn't want nothin' from you
Just to be like you, my king

[Outro]
Give it to me, give it to me, everything
You know how I like my world on a string
Give it to me, give it to me, everything
You know how I like my world on a string
You know how I like my world on a string
You know how I like my world on a string
You know how I like my world on a string


Title: Caught You Boy

Lyrics:

Everything you do, everything I like
On the radio, dancin' in the night
Flowers in my hair, roses on the vine
You can be my guy, and I'm your baby, right?

My, my, apple of my eye
Looking really hot while I make ya cherry pie
Show me what you got, got a sparkle in your eye
You're so high

[Chorus]
I'm yours and I'm free and I'm fun
I'm wild as can be, and I want

I'm cool and I'm calm
A dangerous army of one and I caught
Caught you boy, I caught you boy

Every way I move, every way you like
Pulling on my dress, holdin' me too tight
I know we'll probably lose, only got tonight
But I love the way we kiss, love the way we fight

My, my, lookin' really fly
Like the way the bling on your pinkie ring shine
You spin me really fast and you catch me in the sky
I'm so high

[Chorus]
I'm yours and I'm free and I'm fun
I'm wild as can be, and I want
I want you boy, I want you boy
I'm cool and I'm calm
A dangerous army of one and I caught
Caught you boy, I caught you boy

[Bridge]
I wish I may, I wish I might
Have my one true love tonight
Will you be mine?
Oh hi, lookin' kinda shy
Cause the way you put your hands on me
Well I, I can barely breathe
Baby boy you make me sigh-igh-igh-igh

[Chorus]
I'm yours and I'm free and I'm fun

Thunder in the air, trouble on my mind
Hold me in the dark, kiss it all behind
Baby don't be scared, come on honey, smile
Everything is fine now, everything is fine

[Pre-Chorus 3]
My, my, talkin' all night
Laughin' really hard and it makes me wanna cry
I love our playing house, love our dressin'-up nights
Drinks on ice

[Chorus - Variation]
I'm yours and I'm free and I'm fun
I'm wild as can be, and I want
I want you, I want you
I'm cool and I'm calm
A dangerous army of one and I caught
I caught you, I caught you

[Outro]
I caught you boy, I caught you boy
I caught you, I caught you
I caught you boy, I caught you boy
I caught you, I caught you


Title: Change

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
There's somethin' in the wind, I can feel it blowin' in
It's comin' in softly on the wings of a bomb
There's somethin' in the wind, I can feel it blowin' in
It's comin' in hotly and it's coming in strong

[Refrain]
Lately, I've been thinkin' it's just someone else's job to care
Who am I to sympathize when no one gave a damn?
I've been thinkin' it's just someone else's job to care
Who am I to wanna try? But

[Pre-Chorus]
Change is a powerful thing, people are powerful beings
Tryin' to find the power in me to be faithful
Change is a powerful thing, I feel it comin' in me
Maybe by the time summer's done
I'll be able to be honest, capable
Of holdin' you in my arms without lettin' you fall
When I don't feel beautiful or stable
Maybe it's enough to just be where we are because

[Chorus]
Every time that we run, we don't know what it's from
Now we finally slow down, we feel close to it
There's a change gonna come, I don't know where or when
But whenever it does, we'll be here for it

[Verse 2]
There's somethin' in the wind, I can feel it blowin' in
It's comin' in softly on the wings of a song
There's somethin' in the water, I can taste it turnin' sour
It's bitter, I'm coughing, but now it's in my blood

[Refrain]
Lately, I've been thinkin' it's just someone else's job to care
Who am I to sympathize when no one gave a damn?
I've been thinkin' it's just someone else's job to care
'Cause who am I to wanna try? But

[Pre-Chorus]
Change is a powerful thing, people are powerful beings
Tryin' to find the power in me to be faithful
Change is a powerful thing, I feel it comin' in me
Maybe by the time summer's done
I'll be able to be honest, capable
Of holdin' you in my arms without letting you fall
When I don't feel beautiful or stable
Maybe it's enough to just be where we are, because

[Chorus]
Every time that we run, we don't know what it's from
Now we finally slow down, we feel close to it
There's a change gonna come, I don't know where or when
But whenever it does, we'll be here for it

[Outro]
Mmm
Yeah, whenever it does, we'll be here for it
Mmm
Whenever it does, we'll be here for it


Title: Chelsea Hotel No. 2

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
You were talking so brave and so sweet
Giving me head on the unmade bed
While the limousines wait in the street
But those were the reasons and that was New York
We were running for the money and the flesh
And that was called love for the workers in song
Probably still is for those of them left

[Chorus]
Ah, but you got away, didn't you baby?
You just turned your back on the crowd
You got away, I never once heard you say
I need you, I don't need you
I need you, I don't need you
And all of that jiving around

[Verse 2]
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
You were famous, your heart was a legend
You told me again you preferred handsome men
But for me, you would make an exception
And clenching your fist for the ones like us
Who are oppressed by the figures of beauty
You fixed yourself, you said, "Well, never mind
We are ugly, but we have the music."

[Chorus]
Ah, but you got away, didn't you baby?
You just turned your back on the crowd
And you got away, I never once heard you say
I need you, I don't need you
I need you, I don't need you
And all of that jiving around

[Verse 3]
I don't mean to suggest that I loved you the best
I can't keep track of each fallen robin
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
That's all, I don't even think of you that often


Title: Chemtrails Over The Briscola Club

Lyrics:
[Chorus]
I'm on the opposite team as you, my sweet love
There's nothing wrong except that I want to win Briscola
Under the chemtrails over the briscola club
Wearing our jewels while we play cards
Me and my sister just playin' it cool
Under the chemtrails over the Briscola club

[Verse 1]
Take out your card deck and all of your ways to cheat
Go to the Briscola club, the kids are playing there too
Baby, what's your favorite game?
Mine is Briscola
You won't play, you're no fun
Well, I don't care what they think
Keep winning every gamе

Me and my sister just playin' it cool
Under the chemtrails over the Briscola club

[Verse 2]
Meet you for playing cards
At the elementary schools
We laugh about nothing
As the summer gets cool
It's beautiful, Briscola
Normality settles down over me
I'm not bored or unhappy
I'm still so strange and wild

[Chorus]
You're Poker, I'm Briscola
Nobody's grandpa, nobody's grandma
Watching the chemtrails over the Briscola club
Suburbia, the bar
What to do next? Maybe we'll love it
White picket, chemtrails over the Briscola club

[Bridge]
My love, my love
Playing briscola, winning every time
Late night game, I want you on me
Like when we were kids
Under chemtrails and Briscola clubs
It's never too late to win, baby, so don't give up

[Refrain]
It's never too late to win, baby, so don't give up
Under the chemtrails over the briscola club

(You win in Poker, I win in Briscola)

Swing it high like Jesus, wild and free
Dandelions in your hair, baby

Title: Cherry Liquor

Lyrics:
A girl is a gun, sipping malt liquor
She told me its not fun, that theres something quicker
I put my faith in her
She wears my silk pink fur

I will spend my whole life long
Thinking i did something wrong
Her words cut me with a blunt knife
But everythings fine when she kisses me twice

A girl is a bullet, words that will sting
She told me to cool it, words that i will sing
She is so obsessed
It results in emptiness

I will spend my whole life long
Thinking i did something wrong
Her words cut me with a blunt knife
But everythings fine when she kisses me twice

She is the one i adore, i will show up un-announced with flowers at her door
I want her to do anything for me, something that’ll set my spirit free
We found her mums cherry liquor under the stove
Hush baby blue, words i have told
Violet indigo cherry raspberry skies
I didn't realise i was saying goodbye

I will spend my whole life long
Thinking i did something wrong
Her words cut me with a blunt knife
But everythings fine when she kisses me twice

So go there no with joy
Yes, go there
Don't feel low

Don't you worry for them things that she's done

Yes, go there
Don't feel low
'Cause Chet Baker's playin' trumpets alone
For you

[Outro: Lana Del Rey]
So go there now with joy
Yеs, go there
And don't feel low
'Cause Chеt Baker's playin' trumpet alone

Title: Children of the Bad Revolution

Lyrics:
[Intro]
Take me in your fast car, Mercedes
Kissing on your neck while you drive, he, he
Doesn't care, I'm always on my Blackberry
All the time, all the time, buyin' into every lie

[Verse 1]
I'm a flashy little lush, but he thinks I'm really fine
Notorious and wild, takes me where I'm gonna shine
Where the bad boys roll hard, dressin' like James Dean
And the vixen starlets feels so good to be

[Chorus]
We're children of the bad revolution
And partying's the only solution
In our minds, there ain't any confusion
About who we are and what we're gonna be
We're gonna get free, free, free, free, free, free, free
Get free

[Verse 2]
Baby, we are chancers on the scene
Glamour in the gutters, only so RT
Sick graffiti artists and tabloid queen
Mix it up, mix it up
Every 'do you've ever seen

[Verse 3]
We're acting really tough
Like the world belongs to us
Cause it does, yeah, it must
What we do creates the buzz
Where the bad boys blow smoke
Just like they're James Dean
And the it girls blow kisses
Just like Marilyn

[Chorus]
We're children of the bad revolution
And partying's the only solution
In our minds, there ain't any confusion
About who we are and what we're gonna be
We're gonna get free, free, free, free, free, free, free
Get free

[Bridge]
We run for our lives
Break out of our chains
So cuttin' edge
Create our own games
DJ’s, rock stars, posers we are
The new politicians
Dead celebrity editions
And it’s so pornographic
And it’s tragic that the magic makes us free
To be what we wanna be, wanna be

[Chorus - Variation]
We're children of the bad revolution
And partying's the only solution
In our minds, there ain't any confusion
About who we are and what we're gonna be
We're children of the bad revolution
And partying's the only solution
In our minds, there ain't any confusion
About who we are and what we're gonna be
We're gonna get free, free, free, free, free, free, free
Get free
We're gonna get free, oh

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Cinnamon in my teeth
From your kiss, you're touching me
All the pills that you take
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me at arm's length don't work
You try to push me out, but I just find my way back in
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me out, I win

[Chorus]
There's things I wanna say to you
But I'll just let you live
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna talk about
But better not to give
But if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did

[Post-Chorus]
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did

But I'll just let you live

Lyrics:

Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Twenty of 'em wrapped up tight in silk
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill, yeah

[Verse 1]
Jimmy pulls up in his blue Chevy Nova
I have been dyin' for him to come over
I'm in my party dress, he say "You such a mess"
I am the New Jersey dance queen
He is the gangster action king
He knows that I be selling the body
My man the best 'cause he knows what’s up

[Pre-Chorus]
He knows it's a big bad world
Knows that I'm a good girl
He understands the sale of self
'Cause cash comes quick when looks can kill

[Chorus]
And there's nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Twenty of 'em wrapped up tight in silk

He knows that I be looking to die
He said "Baby, pay respect to the high"

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not invincible
But cash come quick when looks can kill

And there's nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill

But there's nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill

Title: Coachella - Woodstock in My Mind

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I was at Coachella leanin' on your shoulder
Watchin' your husband swing in time
I guess I was in it 'cause, baby, for a minute
It was Woodstock in my mind
In the next mornin', they put out the warnin'
Tensions were risin' over country lines
I turned off the music, tried to sit and use it
All of the love that I saw that night

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause what about all these children
And what about all their parents?
And what about all their crowns they wear
In hair so long like mine?
And what about all their wishes
Wrapped up like garland roses
Around their little heads?
I said a prayer for a third time

[Chorus]
I'd trade it all for a stairway to Heaven (A stairway, stairway to Heaven)
I'd take my time for the climb up to the top of it (A stairway)
I'd trade the fame and the fortune and the legend (Stairway)
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask Him one question
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask Him one question

[Verse 2]
I was at Coachella leanin' on your shoulder
Watchin' your husband swing and shine
I'd say he was hella cool to win them over
Critics can be so mean sometimes
He was on his knees and I thought he was breakin' 'em down
With his words and his voice divine
Doesn't take a genius to know what you've got goin'
And to not wanna lose it 'cause they lost their minds

[Pre-Chorus]
What about all these children
And all their children's children?
And why am I even wonderin' that today?
Maybe my contribution could be as small as hoping
That words could turn to birds
And birds would send my thoughts your way

[Chorus]
I'd trade it all for a stairway to Heaven (A stairway, stairway to Heaven)
I'd take my time for the climb up to the top of it (A stairway)
I'd trade the fame and the fortune and the legend (Stairway)
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask Him one question
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask Him one question

[Post-Chorus]
A stairway, stairway to Heaven
(Na-na, na-na)
A stairway

[Bridge]
Got a million things I wanna say
Like, what's it all for? Will it be okay?
(A stairway, stairway to Heaven)
Million things I wanna say
Like, what's it all for?
(A stairway)

[Outro]
Ooh
Ooh (Stairway, stairway to Heaven)
Ooh (Na-na)
Ooh (Stairway)
Oh (Stairway, stairway to Heaven)
Oh (Stairway)

Peace, we can't have it
And we don't want it
Please, you've got habits
And you won't stop it (stop it)

[Pre-Chorus]
And I threw all your stuff out of my window, and I didn't even blink an eye
Though I do admit that when I called your other bitch, I told a little lie
I told her no matter what no two people were ever happier in life
That part wasn't true, but it felt good to yell and good to hear a little sigh

[Chorus]
You make me cry
You make me kill
You make me wanna die
And we break up
And we get back
I wanna fucking die

[Post-Chorus]
It's you
I love you, I love you

But love
A foreign concept
A foreign country
Touch, that's all we've got
So babe, just touch me (Touch me, touch me)

[Pre-Chorus]
But I threw all your shit out of my window
And I even deleted your cell
Then I called your bitch
I told her that she got her wish, she shouldn't kiss and tell
That part wasn't true 'cause she said nothing
I saw everything for myself
I don't wish you well
I hope it all goes wrong
And baby, I'll see you in Hell

[Chorus]
You make me cry
You make me kill
You make me wanna die
And we break up
And we get back
I wanna fucking die

[Post-Chorus]
It's you
I love you, I love you
It's true
I love you, I love you

Peace, we can't have it

Though I do admit that when I called your other bitch I told a little lie

[Chorus]
You make me cry
You make me kill
You make me wanna die
And we break up
And we get back
I wanna fucking die

Lyrics:
Now you say you're lonely
You cried the whole night through
Well, you can cry me a river, cry me a river honey
I cried a river over you

Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well, you can cry me a river, cry me a river baby
Cause I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me, right out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember, all that you said
You told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me and

Now you say, you say you love me
Well, just to prove you do
Come on boy, cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

You say you're lonely
You cried the whole night through
Well, you can cry me a river, cry me a river baby
I cried a river over you

Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well, you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you
I cried a river over you

I know they say I'm cheap
And you're two-timing me
That's what you get
We're in the 21st century
So much for chivalry
I know you'll come to me
I have a way with men like you, baby

[Chorus]
You're all I wanted, boy, I never needed anybody else
Your logic's flawed and you've been telling lies to yourself
When you gonna let your little baby come, oh, come to you
When you gonna let me drive you crazy like nobody do
You're all I needed boy, I never needed anybody else
I know you're scared to see me only and nobody else
When you gonna love your baby?
When you gonna love your baby?

[Verse 2]
I did the Playboy dip that made us famous
And you was watching there with your crew
I should have known just by the circumstances and who
I was meeting you through
That you were bad news

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I know that's not the way
Most people meet but, hey
We're living in the fast lane
Post-modern day
You're not sure you can change
Or get out of the game
You're not the only one
I've heard say, "Maybe"

[Chorus]
You're all I wanted, boy, I never needed anybody else
Your logic's flawed and you've been telling lies to yourself
When you gonna let your baby tie you up and drive you crazy?
You're all I needed boy, I never needed anybody else
I know you're scared to see me only and nobody else
When you gonna love your baby?
When you gonna love your baby?


Title: Cult Leader

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Jim takes me down, he's a fire eater
Before the dawn or the valley shines
Jim takes me down to the river
All the way, past the mines
Girls in nightgowns hold their hands forever
Girls with pink lips cultivate the sound
They watch, we kiss on a bed of roses
As he lays me down

[Chorus]
He's a fire eater
He's a cult leader
He's a big believer in anything from the 70's
Said that LSD could be good for me
Lay down, lay down

[Verse 2]
Jim takes me down to the village diner
Makes them believe that there's nothing wrong
Parades me 'round like his fucking daughter
All the way, bow down

[Chorus]
He's a fire eater
He's a cult leader
He's a big believer in anything from the 70's
Said that LSD could be good for me
Lay down, lay down

[Bridge]
Oh, all the ways that your story was a let down
Oh-oh-oh, all the ways that your glory was a let down

[Chorus]
He's a fire eater
He's a cult leader
He's a big believer in anything from the 70's
Said that LSD could be good for me
Lay down, lay down
Lay down, lay down


Title: Daddy Issues

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Lana Del Rey & Jesse]
Take you like a drug
I taste you on my tongue

[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey & Jesse]
You ask me what I'm thinking about
I tell you that I'm thinking about
Whatever you're thinking about
Tell me something that I'll forget
And you might have to tell me again
It's crazy what you'll do for a friend

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey & Jesse]
Go ahead and cry, little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And if you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues, and I do too

[Verse 2: Lana Del Rey & Jesse]
I tried to write your name in the rain
But the rain never came
So I made with the sun
The shade
Always comеs at the worst time

[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey & Jesse]
You ask me what I'm thinking about
I tеll you that I'm thinking about
Whatever you're thinking about
Tell me something that I'll forget
And you might have to tell me again
It's crazy what you'll do for a friend

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey & Jesse]
Go ahead and cry, little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And if you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues

[Bridge: Lana Del Rey & Jesse]
I keep on trying to let you go
I'm dying to let you know
How I'm getting on
I didn't cry when you left at first
But now that you're dead it hurts
This time I gotta know
Where did my daddy go?
I'm not entirely here
Half of me has disappeared
Go ahead and cry, little boy
You know that your daddy did too
You know what your mama went through
You gotta let it out soon, just let it out

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey & Jesse]
Go ahead and cry, little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And if you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues, and I do too
If you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues, and I do too
Yeah, yeah

[Outro: Lana Del Rey & Jesse]
I know you got [?], girl
And I've got the same problem, girl
But I can [?], girl
[?]
I know that you got daddy issues, and I do too


Title: Daddy’s Girl

Lyrics:
Ah, right

Take the pain away
I can be the star that burn in the dark
Take your pain away

Title: Damn You

Lyrics:
[Chorus]
I won't cry myself to sleep like a sucker
I won't cry myself to sleep
If I do, I'll die
Now, you fall asleep with another
Damn you

[Verse 1]
'Member how we used to escape for the summer?
Fireworks and sparklers would light up the black skies
We'd hold on tight for our lives to each other
Hello, hello, where did you go?

[Pre-Chorus]
We were two kids livin' life on the run
Like the American dream, baby
Nothing to lose and we'd get messed up for fun
We went too fast, too young

[Chorus]
But I won't cry myself to sleep like a sucker
I won't cry myself to sleep
If I do, I'll die
Now, you fall asleep with another
Damn you
Damn you

[Verse 2]
Flowers in my hair, and your breath smelled like whiskey
Promise anywhere that I go, take you with me
Dancing on your feet, like a child, to the radio
Hello, hello, where did you go?

[Pre-Chorus]
We were two kids living life on the run
Of the American dream, baby
Nothing to lose and we'd get messed up for fun
We went too fast, too young

[Chorus]
But I won't cry my self to sleep like a sucker
I won't cry myself to sleep
If I do, I'll die
Now, you fall asleep with another
Damn you
Damn you
Damn you
Damn you

[Bridge]
Every once in a lifetime
Dreams can come true
Now and then, when the stars shine
You meet somebody like you

[Chorus]
And I won't cry myself to sleep like a sucker
I won't cry myself to sleep
If I do, I'll die
I pray your life is sweet, you fucker
Damn you
Oh, oh, damn you
Damn you

Title: Dance Me to the End of Love

Lyrics:
Note: The following are the lyrics of the original song
Lana's version might differ (if it ever resurfaces)

[Verse 1]
Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
Dance me through the panic 'til I'm gathered safely in
Lift me like an olive branch and be my homeward dove
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love

[Verse 2]
Oh, let me see your beauty when the witnesses are gone
Let me feel you moving like they do in Babylon
Show me slowly what I only know the limits of
Oh, dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love

[Verse 3]
Dance me to the wedding now, oh, dance me on and on
Dance me very tenderly and dance me very long
We're both of us beneath our love, we're both of us above
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love

[Verse 4]
Dance me to the children who are asking to be born
Dance me through the curtains that our kisses have outworn
Raise a tent of shelter now, though every thread is torn
Dance me to the end of love

[Verse 5]
Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
Dance me through the panic 'til I'm gathered safely in
Touch me with your naked hand, touch me with your glove
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love


Title: Dance Till We Die

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I'm coverin' Joni and I'm dancin' with Joan
Stevie is callin' on the telephone
Court almost burned down my home
But God, it feels good not to be alone

[Pre-Chorus]
But sometimes, this ranch feels like my only friend
And life doesn't always work out like we planned
We keep it movin', babe

[Chorus]
So we made it back in the middle of the night
To the Louisiana two-step, high and bright
And we won't say when, we won't ask why
We won't stop dancin' 'til we die
We'll keep walkin' on the sunny side
And we won't stop dancin' 'til we die

[Verse 2]
Troubled by my circumstancе
Burdened by the wеight of fame
Clementine's not just a fruit
It's my daughter's chosen name

[Pre-Chorus]
And when all the bars close down tonight
There's one that stays open just for us, alright
We keep dancin', babe

[Chorus]
So we made it back in the middle of the night (We keep dancin', babe)
To the Louisiana two-step, high and bright (We keep it movin', babe)
And we won't say when, we won't ask why
We won't stop dancin' 'til we die
We'll keep walkin' on the sunny side
And we won't stop dancin' 'til we die

[Bridge]
I went down to Woodside
I left Berkeley, out of city, out of mind
Killin' it, talkin' shit, Joan said she was gonna quit
Tearin' it up at the Afro-Caribbean two-step
I left San Francisco
I've been coverin' Joni and I'm dancin' with Joan
It's kinda hard to find love
When you're used to rollin' like a rollin' stone

[Chorus]
So we made it back in the middle of the night (We keep it movin', babe)
To the Louisiana two-step, high and bright (We keep dancin', babe)
And we won't say when, we won't ask why
We won't stop dancin' 'til we die
We'll keep walkin' on the sunny side
And we won't stop dancin' 'til we die
And we won't stop dancin' 'til we die


Title: Dance With The Devil

Lyrics:
[Hook: Lana Del Rey]
We get down every Friday night
Dancing and grinding in the pale moonlight
Grand Ole Opry
We're feeling alright
Mary prays the rosary for my broken mind
(She said dont worry 'bout it)

[Verse 1: Mike Bars]
Man, it was one of them nights when my conscience got lost in my ego, I was feelin like I'm Suge Knight
I heard the devil in my ear, tryna' tell me to do wrong, but Imma' brush it off and have a good night
It looked like a fucking rave the way this place lit up in flames when I came in with my iPod
And it’s a motherfucking shame that these dames don’t know how to behave but I pray they never find God
Cause my God, when she stepped in even my best friend said "she’s a little devil dressed up as Goddess"
Looking just like Beyonce, that’s his fucking fiance, my homie put a gold ring on that like Sonic
And honest, I  thought he picked a good girl 'til that night when he got up to go get her a drink
I knew that something was wrong, she waited 'til he was gone, put her hand on my arm and then gave me a wink

[Hook: Lana Del Rey]

[Verse 2: Mike Bars]
This is the definition of a taboo
Even coming to this party was a bad move
I know that my best friend will be back soon
But she whispers in my ear to meet her in the bathroom
I've been sticking by the Bro Code since I had a Yo-Yo; fucking with a ho was a no-go
But for some reason these demons inside me are fiending to cut loose - now my heart is frozen like a Snow Cone
I never thought that I would feel like this
It's like a movie with a real life twist
I feel like a fucking nut case. Just to get a couple cupcakes, tell me, man, what will I risk?
I've got to try to get away from her, feel like I’m a slave to her, but somehow I know I  can’t escape from her
Even though I know if I do it I’m gonna ruin the future I got
But somehow we still might kiss

[Hook: Lana Del Rey]

[Verse 3: Mike Bars]
Tell me have you ever looked in the eyes of the Devil and danced in the Midnight hour?
Cause right now she got me
I've done my dirt and now I've got a date down in Hell and I'm ready to make my vows
Cause right now she got me
She put her clothes on in fast forward
Then I slipped out the backdoor
I guess I asked for this by tryna' rap and shit but this is not what I asked for
He was waiting on the back porch...what the fuck have I done? Can’t believe I let it come to this
I looked up said, “Yo, theres something I got to say"
He said, "I know, I'm the one who put her up to it"

[Hook: Lana Del Rey]


Title: Dangerous Girl

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
He's my drugstore cowboy
Italian alloy, classical American
And I'm America's sweetheart
Chic, delicious, sweet tart
Sipping on my Diet Coke
Singin' in the trailer park

[Verse 2]
He like my jeans tight (Yeah)
He likes me mean, right? (Right)
He like my long hair, corset, heels high
We were born to kill, stripped for success
I'm his sweet mess
Do you love me? Yes, yes
Hell yes!

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I'm a four alarm fire
And I'm what you desire
Like a siren in the night
(Going Nero, Nero)
Baby you's a man on the wire
Risking all that you got
For the love of your life
(You're my hero, hero)

[Chorus]
Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl

[Verse 3]
He's the get-rich-quick type
Mafioso-hit type
Girl, I'm gonna marry him
I'm the bad girl next door
Baby's always wantin' more
Buyin' diamond jewelry
Take me to the Jersey Shore

[Verse 4]
He like my mink white (White)
We go out all night (Night)
We're living off the grid
Shinin' in the crime light
We were born to kill, best of the best
The new wild west
Honey, put on that party dress
Hell yes!

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I'm a four alarm fire
And I'm what you desire
Like a siren in the night
(Going Nero, Nero)
Baby you's a man on the wire
Risking all that you got
For the love of your life
(You're my hero, hero)

[Chorus]
Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl

[Bridge]
Me and my baby plannin' world domination
Together, takin' over our fair nation
'Cause we're born to kill, keepin' it fresh
Gold chain, white mesh
Fame is the name of the game
Yes, yes (Yes, yes, yes, yes)

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I'm a four alarm fire
And I'm what you desire
Like a siren in the night
(Going Nero, Nero)
Baby you's a man on the wire
Risking all that you got
For the love of your life
(You're my hero, hero)
Baby, I'm a four alarm fire
And I'm what you desire
Like a siren in the night
(Going Nero, Nero)
Baby you's a man on the wire
Risking all that you got
For the love of your life
(You're my hero, hero)

[Chorus]
Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I'm a four alarm fire
And I'm what you desire
Like a siren in the night
(Going Nero, Nero)
Baby you's a man on the wire
Risking all that you got
For the love of your life
(You're my hero, hero)

[Chorus]
Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl


Title: Dark But Just a Game

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
"It's dark, but just a game"
That's what he would say to me
The faces aren't the same, but their stories all end tragically
(Sweet or whatever, baby)
And that's the price of fame
A tale as old as time you'd be (Sweet or whatever, baby)
A pretty little fool to think exceptions to the rule
Just walk around like you and me, this way
But life is sweet or whatever, baby
You gotta take them for what they got
And while the whole world is crazy
We're getting high in the parking lot

[Chorus]
Wе keep changing all the time
The bеst ones lost their minds
So I'm not gonna change
I'll stay the same
No rose left on the vines
Don't even want what's mine
Much less the fame
It's dark, but just a game
It's dark, but just a game

[Verse 2]
It's dark, but just a game
So play it like a symphony
You know our love's the same, they'll both go down in infamy
I was a pretty little thing and God, I loved to sing
But nothing came from either one but pain (But fuck it)
Life is sweet or whatever, baby
Don't ever think it's not
While the whole world is crazy
We're making out in the parking lot

[Chorus]
We keep changing all the time
The best ones lost their minds
So I'm not gonna change
I'll stay the same
No rose left on the vines
Don't even want what's mine
Much less the fame
It's dark, but just a game
We keep changing all the time
The best ones lost their minds
So I'm not gonna change
I'll stay the same
No rose left on the vines
Don't even want what's mine
Much less the fame
It's dark, but just a game
It's dark, but just a game
It's dark, but just—


Title: Dark City

Lyrics:
[Snippet 1]
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Yeah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Love me or hate me
I'm going to leave
'Cause you told me my dark city
Hold me by demand

[Snippet 2]
Cali is hot
But none of that matters me now
New York was hard and now it’s not


Title: Dark Paradise

Lyrics:
[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
All my friends tell me I should move on
I'm lying in the ocean, singing your song
That's how you sang it

[Verse 1: DJ DX]
It's the dream of my life to speak on this mic
And through the whirlpool, I can talk to Christ
Right or wrong? I made hit songs
I was born to preform with an artofon
Through the shining light and that umbilical cord
An angel appeared and kept me warm
But my sister left and ever since then
I've been so depressed
That's why I never settle for less
I work hard and pray to God each and everyday
I'm blessed in so many ways, yeah
I get to see another day
But wait, is it fate or fortune?
I got to be cautious, hopping out off them Porsches
Everything that glitz definitely ain't glamour
I learned this little secret from my Grandma
(That's how you sang it)
Rest In Peace, I know you're with Nanna

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
All my friends tell me I should move on
I'm lying in the ocean, singing your song
That's how you sang it
All my friends tell me I should move on
I'm lying in the ocean, singing your song
That's how you sang it

[Verse 2: DJ DX]
I gave you everything in this beautiful world
Momma told me, never ever trust no girl
I gave you pearls and I gave you money
Shopping sprees all across the country
Now I'm in the hood, broke and hungry
Rest in Peace, I just Lost my homie
Don't you call me ever again
For living a lie, now you lost a friend
Through this pen and this booth
I free my sins when I release the truth
Heaven on Earth, I'll see you soon
I look at the Moon cause my life is doomed
Stay tuned and thank you
Your mother should've named you Ungrateful
Look at the good that God gave you
(That's how you sang it)
You fucked it up as days grew

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
All my friends tell me I should move on
I'm lying in the ocean, singing your song
That's how you sang it
All my friends tell me I should move on
I'm lying in the ocean, singing your song
That's how you sang it

[Verse 3]
I solemnly swear on this beat
I gave everything up in these streets
Just so we can live and have some peace
I keep in memory just for the deceased
I would scream but don't take it there
You cheated on me and had an affair
Love is blind, that shit ain't clear
Trial after trial, but I'm still here
Feels like I'm crippled in a wheelchair
Propelled still to be a millionaire
What up Madden, what up Wiz
When I'm gone, just know I cared
I showed the world love but they treated me weird
I guess that's how it is when God is near
(That's how you sang it)

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
All my friends tell me I should move on
I'm lying in the ocean, singing your song
That's how you sang it


Title: Dark Paradise at GrassLands

Lyrics:
Everybody told me I was falling in love
I said, you would fall too
If you knew what I was dreaming of
Everybody told me I was stupid, because
You were bad, you were wrong and I knew it


Title: ‎dark paraside

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
All my friends tell me I should move on
I'm lying in the ocean, singing your song (Ah)
That's how you sang it
Loving you forever can't be wrong
Even though you're not here, won't move on (Ah)
That's how we played it

[Pre-Chorus]
And there's no remedy for memory, your face is like a melody
It won't leave my head
Your soul is haunting me and telling me that everything is fine
But I wish I was dead (Dead, like you)

[Chorus]
Every time I close my eyes, it's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side
Every time I close my eyes, it's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side

[Verse 2]
All my friends ask me why I stay strong
Tell 'em when you find true love, it lives on (Ah)
That's why I stay here

[Pre-Chorus]
And there's no remedy for memory, your face is like a melody
It won't leave my head
Your soul is haunting me and telling me that everything is fine
But I wish I was dead (Dead, like you)

[Chorus]
Every time I close my eyes, it's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side
Every time I close my eyes, it's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
But there's no you, except in my dreams tonight

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, ha-ha-ha-ha
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight
Oh-oh-oh-oh, ha-ha-ha-ha
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight

[Bridge]
There's no relief, I see you in my sleep
And everybody's rushing me, but I can feel you touching me
There's no release, I feel you in my dreams
Telling me I'm fine

[Chorus]
Every time I close my eyes, it's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side
Every time I close my eyes, it's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
But there's no you, except in my dreams tonight

[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, ha-ha-ha-ha
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight
Oh-oh-oh-oh, ha-ha-ha-ha
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight


Title: Dayglo Reflection

Lyrics:
[Intro: Sam Cooke]
As a singer grows older, his conception goes a little deeper
Because he lives life and he understands
What he's trying to say a little more

[Verse 1: Bobby Womack]
The earth is but a Dayglo reflection
A turn that will bring you only life
I'm forming to myself, but I'm not broken
Waiting for the day to bring me life

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
If everything said everything is everything
The only thing I ever dreamed is you and me
'Cause I break down, I take you down
And I love it every step of the way
Ooh, ah, ah, ah

[Bridge: Sam Cooke]
As a singer grows older, his conception goes a little deeper
Because he lives life and he understands
What he's trying to say a little more
As the singer tries to find out what's happening in life
It gives him a better insight
On telling the story of the song he's trying to sing

[Verse 2: Lana Del Rey]
Watching from a distant constellation
Eyes that can see the world in changing hues
Visions still unfold in sweet imagining
Time reveals that love is the only truth

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
If everything said everything is everything
The only thing I ever dreamed is you and me
'Cause I break down, I take you down
And I love it every step of the way
Ooh, ah, ah, ah


Title: Daytona Meth

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
It's like a Hollywood movie
The black and white waves sparkling truly
My man likes to watch me while I watch TV
While he's t-t-touching me

[Verse 2]
I remember vintage green wallpaper
Your criminal arms, I couldn't feel safer
King Creole daddy, chasing that paper
I l-l-love you

[Chorus 1]
Baby you'll never be old in my eyes
With your golden grill true love never dies
We're forever young in paradise
As long as you got the Chevrolet, I will ride
I will ride
I will ride

[Chorus 2]
Baby you know mama never had much money
But I plan on using this face to pay, honey
Give me give me give me give
You're so funny, love you 'til I die

[Verse 3]
Who's living life like it's the Belvedere
Swinging all night on the crystal chandelier
Bring that velvet Elvis over here

[Outro]
Come on, baby you never know 'til you try
Baby you never live 'til you die
Baby you never love 'til you're mine
C'mon you're mine, you're mine, you're mine


Title: Dead to Me

Sleeping on my sofa while your mom is out of—


Title: Dealer

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Miles Kane]
Please don't try to find me through my dealer
He won't pick up his phone
Please don't try my father either
He ain't been home for years
I know I'm no spirit-seeker
I can't sleep through the tears
I get lost in the ether

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey, Lana Del Rey & Miles Kane]
I check in, I wreck it, I turn it around
I gave you all my money, gave you all my money
Gave you all my money, gave you all my money
I don't wanna live
I don't wanna give you nothing
'Cause you never give me nothing back
Why can't you be good for something?
Not one shirt off your back
Why can't you be good for something?
Not one shirt off your back

[Verse 2: Miles Kane]
Please don't try to find me through my dealer
He won't pick up his phone
Please don't try my doctor either
He won't take any calls
He's no fucking spirit healer
We just can't stop to talk
But he's gone now for the weekend

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
I check in, I wreck it, and I'll explain
I gave you all my money, gave you all my money
Gave you all my money, gave you all my money
I don't wanna live
I don't wanna give you nothing
'Cause you never give me nothing back
Why can't you be good for something?
Not one shirt off your back
Why can't you be good for something?
Not one shirt off your back

[Outro: Miles Kane & Lana Del Rey]
555
Please don't try to find me through my dealer (9275, 555)
He won't pick up his phone (Now you've got a busy tone)
All circuits are busy, goodbye
All circuits are busy, you're high
Please don't try my father either (All circuits are busy, goodbye)
He ain't been home for years (All circuits are busy, you're high)


Title: Dear Elliot

Lyrics:
You didn’t think about anyone else
You didn’t think about any of us when you left that place
You didn’t wanna go anywhere else
Nothing could satisfy you 'til you left
So you went away

Where'd you go?
Where are you now?
I ask about, so many of my friends
Oh, about their ends
What about us?
Are we just dust on the floor again?
I thought we were on the mend

You really put me in quite a position
You got me struggling as a musician with a song
You like to write about all of your problems
Put them in songs because you think it would solve them
But you’re wrong

Why did you go?
I guess I know
Maybe my question is, why must it come to this?
You talk about being strong, yeah
And how I want to be you and your melody

Trying to learn about something important
But you keep taking up space, you’re annoying
But I love you so
Yeah, you already know

They're trying to teach me about new ways of living
They’re trying to teach me about ways of forgiving
But you make it hard
You’re such a bad, bad boy

I love you anyway
No matter what they say
You are not a prude, but you are on the move
I care about how this turns out
It’s just more than I ever knew how to fight
I guess I won't

Tell me I have to, tell me I have to
I know you could
I said I know you could
Where are you now?
I ask about


Title: Dear Future Wife

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Luka]
Dear Future Wife
I pray before I meet you I go blind
Hmmm, okay, not physically but metaphysically
I pray that my eyes don’t drown in the sea of your beauty
That the planet of my heart is not illuminated by the sun of your smile
That my emotions are not strangled by the curves of your body
I pray that I may never get so lost in the richness of your eyes
I forget about the poverty of life
That the vacuum of your sight may never make me lose my breath

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
Will you still love me when  I’m no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will
I know you will
I know that you will
Will you still love me when I’m longer beautiful?
Will you still love me when I’m no longer young and beautiful??

[Verse 2: Luka]
‘Cause I know the blasphemy of my eyes
The idolatry of media shrines
That strip you of your substance and glorify the superficial
I've worshiped in their temples
With Twerk Prophets, Bikini Priests and Apostles of Lust
Sacrificed your worth at the altar of porn
I don’t know how to find you in the garbage bag of my retinas
‘Cause I've dated girls whose beauty had me way past tipsy – I'm drunk!
But when the hangover of their personality hit me
It burnt the liver of my hope

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
Will you still love me when  I’m no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will
I know you will
I know that you will
Will you still love me when I’m longer beautiful?
Will you still love me when I’m no longer young and beautiful??

[Verse 3: Luka]
I pray I may have the courage to appreciate God’s love That shines through the torch of your service
For the grace to walk through the hallways of your mind And unlock the doors of Heaven’s intellect stashed away
The faith to look past your physical flaws
And appreciate the beauty of your spirit
And if I’m ever amazed at your physical beauty
Maybe when you're sixty-five with missing teeth and saggy cheeks
May I look at you with the eyes of a love-struck teenager and say
“Baby, how you so young and beautiful.”

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
Will you still love me when  I’m no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will
I know you will
I know that you will
Will you still love me when I’m longer beautiful?
Will you still love me when I’m no longer young and beautiful??

Title: Devil Red

Lyrics:
Verse 1
The silent shadows creep all around me
They're screaming begging to be free
Angels cry and devils die
The heart I hold isn't mine
I believe it belongs to you
So let the sirens scream my name

Chorus
His eyes were devil red
I'd rather lie in bed
Loving you is not what I meant
My perception of reality's bent
I'm a two-timing, bad lying jerk you sleep with
I'm a dirty little freak who's in need of your lovе
But believe mе when I say this
His eyes were devil red
I know his eyes were devil red

Verse 2
I see a shining light in my heart
Every night you're on my mind
Days fly by and I don't have a clue
I'll steal your man out of the blue
Cameras catch my smiles but never my wit
I don't ever wanna put up with this (*yeah*)

Chorus
His eyes were devil red
I'd rather lie in bed
Loving you is not what I meant
My perception of reality's bent
I'm a two-timing, bad lying jerk you sleep with
I'm a dirty little freak who's in need of your love
But believe me when I say this
His eyes were devil red
I know his eyes were devil red

Bridge
Dirty little liar in my bed
All the ******* stories
I couldn't take it
I started some mischief
Broken but better
Private but not the Jetsetter
Fake but the realest
I'm a surrealist
Look at my artwork
He is my destiny
He's gonna set me free
It's just you and me

Chorus
His eyes were devil red (r-e-d know what I mean)
I'd rather lie in bed (I said that?)
Loving you is not what I meant (It isn't?)
My perception of reality's bent (I'm confused)
I'm a two-timing, bad lying jerk you sleep with (true)
I'm a dirty little freak who's in need of your love (no way)
But believe me when I say this (OK go for it)
His eyes were devil red
I know his eyes were devil red
His eyes were devil red
I know his eyes were devil red
Red like a devil
Falls on me like an anvil
I'm tired of this
Listen to me when I say
His eyes were devil red


Title: Diamonds and Rust

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Joan Baez]
Well I'll be damned
Here comes your ghost again
But that's not unusual
It's just that the moon is full
And you happened to call
And here I sit
Hand on the telephone
Hearing a voice I'd known
A couple of light years ago
Heading straight for a fall

[Verse 2: Lana Del Rey & Joan Baez]
As I remember your eyes
Were bluer than robin's eggs
My poetry was lousy you said
But where are you calling from?
A booth in the midwest
(In the) fifty years ago
I bought you some cufflinks
You brought me something
We both know what memoriеs can bring
They bring diamonds and rust

[Verse 3: Lana Del Rey & Joan Baez]
Well you burst on the scеne
Already a legend
The unwashed phenomenon
The original vagabond
You strayed into my arms
And there you stayed
Temporarily lost at sea
The Madonna was yours for free
Yes the girl on the half-shell
Would keep you unharmed

[Verse 4: Lana Del Rey & Joan Baez]
I see you standing
With brown leaves falling around
Snow in your hair
Now you're smiling out the window
Of that crummy hotel
Over Washington Square
Our breath comes out white clouds
Mingles and hangs in the air
Speaking strictly for me
We both could have... then and there

[Verse 5: Lana Del Rey & Joan Baez]
Now you're telling me
You're not nostalgic
Then give me another word for it
You who are so good with words
And at keeping things vague
Because I need some of that vagueness now
It's all come back too clearly
I once loved you dearly
And if you're offering me diamonds and rust
I've already paid


Title: Did you know that there’s a tunnel under Ocean Blvd

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Did you know that there's a tunnel under Ocean Boulevard?
Mosaic ceilings, painted tiles on the wall
I can't help but feel somewhat like my body marred my soul
Handmade beauty sealed up by two man-made walls

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm like
When's it gonna be my turn?
When's it gonna be my turn?

[Chorus]
Open me up, tell me you like it
Fuck me to death, love me until I love myself
There's a tunnel under Ocean Boulevard
Therе's a tunnel under Ocean Boulеvard

[Verse 2]
There's a girl who sings "Hotel California"
Not because she loves the notes or sounds that sound like Florida
It's because she's in a world, preserved, only a few have found the door
It's like Camarillo, only silver mirrors, running down the corridor

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, man
When's it gonna be my turn?
Don't forget me
When's it gonna be my turn?

[Chorus]
Open me up, tell me you like me
Fuck me to death, love me until I love myself
There's a tunnel under Ocean Boulevard
Don't forget me
There's a tunnel under Ocean Boulevard

[Verse 3]
Harry Nilsson has a song, his voice breaks at 2:05
Something about the way he says "Don't forget me" makes me feel like
I just wish I had a friend like him, someone to give me five
Lennon in my back, whisperin' in my ear
"Come on, baby, you can thrive"
But I can't

[Pre-Chorus]
When's it gonna be my turn?
Don't forget me
When's it gonna be my turn?

[Chorus]
Open me up, tell me you like it
Fuck me to death, love me until I love myself
There's a tunnel under Ocean Boulevard
Don't forget me
Like the tunnel under Ocean Boulevard
Don't forget me
Like the tunnel under Ocean Boulevard
Don't forget me
Like the tunnel under Ocean Boulevard (Yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
Yeah, oh
Don't forget me, don't forget me
No, don't, don't forget me
Don't you, don't you forget me (No, no)
Oh

You're no good for me
Baby, you're no good for me

Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?

Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?

Baby, put on heart-shaped sunglasses
'Cause we gonna take a ride

Say it's gonna be alright

[Verse 2]
Let's take Jesus off the dashboard
Got enough on his mind
We both know just what we're here for
Saved too many times
Maybe I like this roller coaster
Maybe it keeps me high
Maybe the speed, it brings me closer
I could sparkle up your eye

[Chorus]
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Can we hit it now, low-down and gritty?
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?

You're no good for me
But, baby, I want you, I want you, I want you

[Chorus]
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?
Baby stoppin' at 7-Eleven
There in his white Pontiac Heaven
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City (You're no good for me)
Can we hit it now, low-down and gritty? (Baby, you're no good for me)
Do you think we'll be in love forever? (You're no good for me)
Do you think we'll be in love? (But, baby, I want you, I want)

You're no good for me
But, baby, I want you, I want
You're no good for me
Baby, you're no good for me
You're no good for me
But, baby, I want you, I want

Lyrics:
[Chorus]
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you wanna get low-down and gritty?
Do you wanna go back out again?

[Verse 1]
We stop at 7-Eleven in his white Pontiac Heaven
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love forever?

[Verse 2]
I can see the sparkle in your eyes
I can see it now as I get closer
Knew that I heard it's no surprise
You're more crazy than a roller coaster
You're more crazy than a rollеr coaster

[Chorus]
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, Nеw York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you wanna get low-down and gritty?
Do you wanna go back out again?

And I am all I wanna be
I try and I believe

Disco, go-go dancer so rare (Mhm)

Lyrics:
[Chorus]
Summertime and the livin's easy
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras MG
All the people in the dance will agree
That we're well-qualified to represent the L.B.C.
Me, me and Louie, we gonna run to the party
And dance to the rhythm, it gets harder

[Verse 1]
Me and my girl, we got this relationship
I love her so bad, but she treats me like shit
On lockdown, like a penitentiary
She spreads her lovin' all over
And when she gets home, there's none left for me

My burning sun will, some day, rise
So what am I gonna be doin' for a while?
Said I'm gonna play with myself
Show them how we come off the shelf

Summertime and the livin's easy
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras MG
All the people in the dance will agree
That we're well-qualified to represent the L.B.C.

And dance to the rhythm, it gets harder
(Harder, yeah, harder, yeah)

Evil, we've come to tell you that she's evil, most definitely
Evil, ornery, scandalous and evil, most definitely
The tension, it's getting hotter
I'd like to hold her head underwater
(Summertime)
(Ah, ah, ah)

[Chorus]
Summertime and the livin's easy
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras MG
All the people in the dance will agree
That we're well-qualified to represent the L.B.C.
Me, me and Louie, we gonna run to the party
And dance to the rhythm, it gets harder

Lyrics:
[Chorus]
Boy, don't call me angel
You ain't got me right
Don't call me angel
You can't pay my price
Ain't from no Heaven
Yeah, you heard me right (Yeah, you heard me right)
Even though you know we fly (Though you know we)
Don't call me angel

[Verse]
Don't call me angel when I'm a mess
Don't call me angel when I get undressed
You know I, I don't like that, boy
Uh, I make my money, and I write the checks
So say my name with a little respect
All my girls successful, and you're just our guest

[Pre-Chorus]
Do I rеally need to say it?
Do I need to say it again, yeah?
You better stop thе sweet talk
And keep your pretty mouth shut

I appreciate the way you watch me, I can't lie
I drop it down, I pick it up, I back it off the county line
Fell from Heaven, now I'm living like a devil
You can't get me off your mind
I appreciate the way you want me, I can't lie
I drop it low, I back it up, I know you wanna think you're mine
Baby, I totally get it, you can't guess so
You can't get me off your mind

[Chorus]
Boy, don't call me angel
You ain't got me right
Don't call me angel
You can't pay my price

Yeah, you heard me right (Yeah, you heard me right)
Even though you know we fly
Don't call me angel

Don't call me angel


Title: Don’t Go Dark

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
What are you gonna ride for no one at all?
Hey, are you gonna cry on demand just to get your number called?
Oh, baby, I know gone, I know gone, I know out of this world
'Cause I've slept in my bed alone next to my girl
So do what you want, just don't go dark on me

[Chorus]
'Cause you run, run, run, run with the wild
Then you cry on my shoulder like a little child
Do what you want, just don't go dark on me
And you're waitin' to be saved, but ain't nobody comin'
It's the same party trick, you're a dream until you're runnin'
Do what you want, just don't go dark on me
Oh, just don't go dark on me

[Post-Chorus]
Run, run, run, run with the wild
You always run, run, run, run with the wild

[Verse 2]
I dream a little dream, she's not out of it
Then I watch her take another pill, take another pic, then flip another switch
And now she's gone, now she's gone, now she's out of this world
It's like California dreamin' got the best of my girl
So do what you want, just take your sights off of me, yeah, hey, hey

[Chorus]
'Cause you run, run, run, run with the wild
Then you cry on my shoulder like a little child
Do what you want, just don't go dark on me
And you're waitin' to be saved, but ain't nobody comin'
If you're holdin' on to me, you're holdin' on to nothing
Do what you want, just don't go dark on me
Well, just don't go dark on me

[Post-Chorus]
Run, run, run, run with the wild
You always run, run, run, run with the wild

[Bridge]
You know, all this time apart, I finally see it, honey
Yeah, you've just been waiting your whole life to find someone who can stand in your storm
I stood there and something was missing
I still see you, honey, babe, but it ain't me that you'll be kissin'

[Chorus]
'Cause you run, run, run, run with the devil
Then you cry on my shoulder like I'm forever
Do what you want, just don't go dark on me
And you keep playin' to that chip, chip on your shoulder
Yeah, you carry that around, it's like tryin' to get to nowhere
Do what you want, just don't go dark on me
Well, just don't go dark on me

[Outro]
Run, run, run, run with the wild
(Are you gonna, are you gonna do this to me?)
Just to run, run, run, run with the wild
(Are you gonna, are you gonna do this to me?)
Just to run, run, run, run with the wild
(Are you gonna, are you gonna do this to me?)
Just to run, run, run, run with the wild
Oh, so you just don't go dark on me
So you just don't go dark on me
Just don't go dark on me, baby


Title: Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Julia Jacklin]
I wanna want you, I wanna stay here like this
I wanna feel it all every time that we kiss
I want your mother to stay friends with mine
I want this feeling to pass in time
But you know my body now and I know yours
We put so many things between these walls
And every gift you buy me, I know what's inside
What do I do now? There's nothing left to find

[Chorus: Julia Jacklin & Lana Del Rey]
Don't know how to keep loving you
Now that I know you so well
Don't know how to keep loving you
Now that I know you so well
Don't know how to keep loving you
Now that I know you so well
Don't know how to keep loving you

[Verse 2: Lana Del Rey]
What if I cleaned up? What if I worked on my skin?
I could scrub until I am red, hot, weak, and thin
Too tired to run away, what do I do now?
There's nothing left to say

[Chorus: Julia Jacklin & Lana Del Rey]
Don't know how to keep loving you
Now that I know you so well
Don't know how to keep loving you
Now that I know you so well
Don't know how to keep loving you
Now that I know you so well
Don't know how to keep loving you

[Verse 3: Julia Jacklin & Both]
Into the darkness
Or is it the light?
Should I be waking up, or finding a place to sleep tonight?
Who will I bе
Now that you're no longer next to mе?

[Chorus: Julia Jacklin & Lana Del Rey]
Don't know how to keep loving you
Now that I know you so well
Don't know how to keep loving you
Now that I know you so well
Don't know how to keep loving you
Now that I know you so well
Don't know how to keep loving you
Don't know how to keep loving you
Now that I know you so well
Don't know how to keep loving you
Now that I know you so well
Don't know how to keep loving you
Now that I know you so well
I just wanna keep loving you


Title: Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Baby, you understand me now
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel?
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad

[Chorus]
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

[Verse 2]
You know sometimes, baby, I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
And then sometimes again, it seems that all I have is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side

[Chorus]
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

[Bridge]
If I seem edgy, I want you to know
I never meant to take it out on you
Life has its problems and I get more than my share
But that's one thing I never mean to do 'cause I love you

[Verse 3]
Oh, baby, I'm just human
Don't you know I have faults like anyone?
Sometimes I find myself alone regretting some little foolish thing
Yeah, some simple thing that I've done

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

[Outro]
I try so hard, don't let me be misunderstood
I try so hard, don't let me be misunderstood


Title: Don’t Stop

Lyrics:
[Chorus]
Don't stop, said you're gonna make me lay naked
Don't stop, said you're gonna make me lay naked
Don't stop, said you're gonna make me lay naked
Don't stop, said you're gonna make me lay naked

[Chorus]
Don't stop, said you're gonna make me lay naked
Don't stop, said you're gonna make me lay naked
Don't stop, said you're gonna make me lay naked
Don't stop, said you're gonna make me lay naked

[Outro]
('Cause, like, 'cause otherwise, like, what would I do?)
(Starting? Got it, oh, got it, okay, right.)


Title: Don’t Think Twice, It’s All Right

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If you really don't know by now
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why
It'll never do somehow
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
Well, look out your window and I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm traveling on
But don't think twice, it's all right

[Verse 2]
Ain't no use calling out my name, babe
Like you never done before
And it ain't no use in calling out my name
I can't hear you anymore
I wish there was something you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
But we nevеr did too much talking anyway
So don't think twice, it's all right

[Verse 3]
It ain't no use turnin' on your light, babe
Thе light I never knowed
Ain't no use in turnin' on your light
I'm on the dark side of the road
I'm thinkin' and wonderin' all the way down the road
I once loved a boy, he's a child I'm told
And I give him my heart, but he wanted my soul
But don't think twice, it's all right

[Verse 4]
I'm going down that long, lonesome road, babe
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
But goodbye's too good a word, babe
I say "Fare thee well"
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
Well, you could have done better but I don't mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
But don't think twice, it's all right

[Outro]
And don't think twice, it's all right

Title: Downtown

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Belly]
You know what you're here for
You heard the stories just admit to it
I say my dick you do a back flip just to get to it
(Fuck) I made this shit just to hit to it
So tell my ex to play this shit and suck a dick to it
It's fucking late
And I can't stand this fucking place
Plus these fucking drugs I ate
Got me mixing love and hate
Sitting in this room
In degrees it feels like 108
She says play it cool
But I don't wanna wait
Bitter sweet but I love the taste
Serve it cold I'll lick the plate
First I take a shot of her
Then I take a shot of liquor straight
Then everything goes numb
And the feelings went away
First this shit had me in love
This what happens when it fades

[Hook: Lana Del Rey]
I'm in his favorite sun dress
Watching me get undressed take that body downtown
I say you're the bestest
Lean in for a big kiss take that body downtown

[Verse 2: Belly]
She scrapes her nails on my tattoos
She wants to leave her ma
And I know she's bad news
This how them rumors start
This shit here past due
Take your shit just leave your heart
I fucking bleed it dry and feed the sharks
Songs of sorrow but people part
And most of the time it's over
Other peoples' parts
She wanna turn the lights on
Leave em off
I still pretend like you're her
Evil Thoughts
I'm talking hurricanes
I'll make your body storm
She's cold hearted
But her body warm
I'm as cold as the sheets
I lay her body on
She's the motherfucking devil
Goddess form

[Hook: Lana Del Rey]
I'm in his favorite sun dress
Watching me get undressed take that body downtown
I say you're the bestest
Lean in for a big kiss take that body downtown
(2x)

[Belly]
I'll take your body (7x) down
I'll take your body downtown
I'll take your body down
You know I'll take your body down


Title: Dragonslayer

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
She is a Spanish señorita
Her eyes are green and her heart is gold
You have a vision, you'd like to meet her
And so you're walking down that road to the sea

[verse 2]
You hear a lotta things about her
Her reputation's widely known
The people talk, but that don't matter
Because to you, she feels like home
You feel free because

[Chorus 1]
She'll never bring you down
You're hot, then she'll bring you water
She wears a flower crown
She is the people's daughter
She's holy, holy
Maria's prayer, the dragonslayer
She's fighting fire by the sea

[Verse 3]
She is a Spanish la Lolita
Her eyes are green and her dress is gold
She is a siren, La femme Nikita
Her children young but her soul is old
She feels free

[Chorus 2]
She'll never bring you down
You're tired, she'll bring you water
She'll never leave this town
She is the father's daughter
She's holy, holy
Maria's prayer, the dragonslayer
She's fighting fire by the sea
Maria's prayer, if you should see her
Give her my best wishes for me

[Bridge]
Holy, dragonslayer
These troubled waters
They don't mean nothing to you
Patron saint of troubled daughters
Hold your light and you have it true
Because you're holy, you're holy
Holy, holy, you're holy, holy

[Chorus]
Maria's prayer, the dragonslayer
She's fighting fire by the sea
Maria's prayer, if you should see her
Give her my best wishes for me


Title: Drama Queen

Lyrics:
[Текст песни "Drama Queen"]

[Интро]

(А-а-а)
Дувати україною як вiдьма зверталася
А ти що? Хі-хі ха-ха
(Хи-хи-ха-ха-ха-ха-ху-ху)

Пусть он лучше будет сидеть в тюрьме
Чем ебаться в жопу, я сказала!
(Ой-ой-ой-ой-ой)

[Куплет]

Став тем, чего боялась
Впредь я больше не смеялась
И что делать я не знала
Пока тебя не отыскала

И не удосужившись ответа
Я ушла в закат
Где луна горит как сигарета
Уничтожая мой последний лучик света

[Бридж]

Пидорасы, вас надо убивать
Как собак диких
(Ты репетировала?)
Почему? Потому-что я вас ненавижу

[Куплет]

Моей пизды во век тебе не увидать
Можешь только ты мечтать
И во сне я не приду к тебе
И утонешь ты в чужой пизде

И скажу что это бред
Не трогай ты меня, забудь...
Ведь решила так судьба
Ну а кто я, чтобы спорить с ней тогда

Скучать по мне ты полюбила
И думаешь что в этом сила
Было раньше всё иначе...
Обнимай ты всех почаще...

[Бридж]

Я уже знаю, и мы это уже сделали (Что?)
И мы это сегодня тоже делали (Что?!)
Ну как бы сказать... Секс! (Оуа! Ах ты!)

[Куплет]

Между нами большая разница
Я не такая как ты, я уже впереди
Эти суки не в моей лиге
Они не бьют так, как я
Они не сильнее меня

Ты говоришь, что любишь ее
Но на самом деле ты любишь меня
У меня есть верные друзья
Они делают то, что скажу им я

И когда эти сучки за спиной пиздят
Я смеюсь, ведь это звучит так
Будто они пытаются быть мной
Я - та, кем ты мечтаешь стать
Королева вернулась убивать!

Эти парни делают вид, что что-то значат
Но когда настоящие убийцы появляются
Эти суки отступают
Между мной и тобой большая разница!

Ты пытаешься быть со мной
Но ты не можешь догнать меня
Глупая сука, ты не такая как я
Твоя зависть и ревность - пустые слова
Получишь по заслугам, тупая пизда!

[Бридж]

(Всем привет это была программа котёнок-поварённок и или мы готовим вместе с чиё? Я даже не знаю как назвать, но мы с моим венчиком пытались приготовить печенье
У меня вроде чёто вышло, но это больше не похоже на сердечки..)

ЗАТКНИСЬ СУКА!!!
(АА-А-А-АА)
(Хи-хи-ха-ха-ха-ха-ху-ху)

[Куплет]

Я никогда не скажу "прости"
Ведь я сделала это специально
И когда стоишь перед королевой
Не веди себя нахально!

[Пред-Припев]

(Ой-ой-ой-ой-ой)
(А-а-а)
И больше не приближайся
Ко мне, глупая сука
Ты меня достала
Убери свои руки

[Припев]

Я могу тратить большие бабки
Я богатая сучка
И у меня всё в порядке
А ты сиди на шее у своего папки
И покупай дешёвые прокладки

Я могу тратить большие бабки
Я богатая сучка
И у меня всё в порядке
Заткнись сука!

[Куплет]

Наша Вера горько плачет
Уронила в письку мячик
Тише, Верочка, не плачь
Не утонет в писе мяч

И не грустно Вере больше
Ведь куни сделал паренёк
Писю лижет попка
Куни, секс, трахдибидох...

[Бридж]

(А-а-а)
И больше не приближайся
Ко мне, глупая сука
Ты меня достала
Убери свои руки!
(Ой-ой-ой-ой-ой)

[Куплет]

Больно сделал ты
Клинком опять ударив
Прямо в сердце
Яд сжёг всё изнутри
А мне пришлось терпеть
С разбитым сердцем

И сняв вишнёвые очки
От ужаса оцепенала я...
Мир жесток и несправедлив
Но кому дано понять меня?...

И плакала я ночью в тишине
В тот час, пока смеялся ты
Приспешники твои скверны!
А ты, хозяин всей этой игры...

Жалею, что когда-то
Поманил меня твой мир
И попала я в твой плен
И снова больно делал ты
А я опять терпела..

[Пред-Припев]

Hey! Hey! Nicki Minaj is the queen of rap!
Nicki Minaj is the queen of rap!
(А-а-а)

[Припев]

Я могу тратить большие бабки
Я богатая сучка
И у меня всё в порядке
А ты сиди на шее у своего папки
И покупай дешёвые прокладки

[Аутро]

Я никогда не скажу "прости"
Ведь я сделала это специально
И когда стоишь перед королевой
Не веди себя нахально!
(Ой-ой-ой-ой-ой)...


Title: Dreamer, I’m sorry for dreaming

Lyrics:
I dream of a life I cannot hold and it consumes me
From moments I look back – and do not get me wrong
I love those around me, wholly
The smiles of their faces and the lights that line their
Glowing eyes in nights that are otherwise intolerable
But I can’t help but yearn for something more. Atleast

That’s what he told me; that I can never be content with
What I have, so long as I keep dreaming of bigger things.
I picture myself on late night walks pondering over it
–Is that the truth? Was there a realness behind his speech?
Was I a dreamer like my father had painted me out to be?

I could never come to a whole conclusion; never yes or no
For I found that nothing is complete - everything is complex
The wind and the world and the creator which we owe
Every little decision encompasses such things, and such things
Are perhaps the toil of my mind. But as I sit here, now, below
The sky that is pouring down, I cannot help but remark to myself

Is dreaming worth death?


Title: Dreamgirl

Lyrics:
[Intro]
I can be your dream girl
I can be your dream girl

[Verse 1]
When you wake up to the day
And see the city, dark and gray
You can already see the curtain coming down
Sittin', open up your files
Right click JARs to see her smile
Transfer to your heart, and let the world go ’round
Shoo-wop shoo, baby

[Chorus]
I can be your dream girl
(Shoo-wop shoo, baby)
I can be your dream girl
(Shoo-wop shoo, baby)
When it all gets too much
Darlin', I'm soft to the touch
Hush, hush and stop your rushing
I can be your dream girl, baby

[Verse 2]
​iPhone ringing, boss is screaming
On the TV, news streaming
It means nothing to you though, you tune it out
Close your eyes and change the station
Switch the pictures on your wavelength
Put me on your playlist, I’m your favorite song
Shoo-wop shoo, baby

[Chorus]
I can be your dream girl
(Shoo-wop shoo, baby)
I can be your dream girl
(Shoo-wop shoo, baby)
When it all gets too much
Darlin', I'm soft to the touch
Hush, hush and stop your rushing
I can be your dream girl, baby

[Bridge]
Candlelight burns twice as bright, baby burns half as long
So keep your fire burning, so you always love me strong
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Woah-woah
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Woah, baby
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Woah-woah
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Woah, baby

[Verse 3]
Now it's night time, driving uptown
City's sparkling, but you shut down
So you signal right and turn your engine off
Cars fly by you, stars beside you
Turn that radio inside you
Tune the station that's playing the one you love
Shoo-wop shoo, baby

[Chorus]
I can be your dream girl
(Shoo-wop shoo, baby)
I can be your dream girl
(Shoo-wop shoo, baby)
I can be your dream girl
I can be your dream girl
When it all gets too much
Darlin', I'm soft to the touch
Hush, hush and stop your rushing
I can be your dream girl, baby
I can be your dream girl, baby


Title: Drive

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I've been out on that open road
You can be my full-time daddy, white and gold
Singing blues has been getting old
You can be my full-time baby, hot or cold

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't break me down (Me down, me down)
I've been traveling too long (Too long, too long)
I've been trying too hard
With one pretty song (Hmm-hmm)

[Chorus]
I hear the birds on the summer breeze
I drive fast, I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble
But I, I've got a war in my mind
So, I just drive, just drive
Just drive, just drive

[Verse 2]
Dying young and playing hard
That's the way my father made his life an art
Drink all day and we talk 'til dark
That's the way the road dogs do it
Light 'til dark

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't leave me now (Me now, me now)
Don't say goodbye (Goodbye, goodbye)
Don't turn around
Leave me high and dry (Hmm-hmm)

[Chorus]
I hear the birds on the summer breeze
I drive fast, I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble
But I, I've got a war in my mind
I just drive, just drive
Just drive, just drive

[Bridge]
You think I'll ever feel different than I do now?
You think I’ll ever feel any magic again
You think I'll ever transform into the man
God meant to make when he began?

[Chorus]
Hear the birds on the summer breeze
I drive fast, I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble
But I, I've got a war in my mind
I just drive, just drive
Just drive, just drive


Title: Drive By

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
It was a drive-by Sunday night
Most of us were in bed all right
I turned down the light
Then I heard the sirens
Interrupt the silence

[Chorus 1]
Is this what you wished
To commit a crime?
Is this what you wished
To commit a crime?
Is this what you wished
To commit a crime, commit a crime, commit a crime?

[Verse 2]
You was a nice guy, really bright
Making money's hard to do right
Guilty was his plight
Now he's in a jail cell
For some thirty years now

[Chorus 2]
Is this what you wished
To be serving time?
Is this what you wished
To be serving time?
Is this what you wished
To be serving time, serving time, serving time?

[Verse 3]
K's a friend of mine
I think about him as he does time
Miss his white wine
Funny I don't feel free
Even though it's not me

[Chorus 3]
Is this what you wished
To leave me behind?
Is this what you wished
To leave me behind?
Is this what you wished
To leave me behind, me behind, me behind?

[Verse 4]
Last year they decided
That his time is up and then he got retried
Double homicide
Sent him on to death row
Not to hang around though

[Chorus 4]
Is this what you wished
Did you want to die?
Is this what you wished
Did you want to die?
Is this what you wished
Did you want to die, want to die, want to die?
Did you want to die, want to die, want to die, want to die?
Did you want to die?


Title: Driving in Cars With Boys

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
They say I'm wasting time, they say that I'm no good
Summer of my life, not doing what I should
Call me poison ivy 'cause I'm far from good
But pretty from afar, like a dark star

[Verse 2]
They think I'm dangerous, they think I'm really bad
I'm just making up for what I never had
Go out every night whenever I feel sad
All this drive-by love got me crazy like a drug

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I wear my red lipstick, got my make-up on
I'm Miss America, now I'm gone, baby, gone
[Pre-Chorus 1: Demo Version]
I wear my red lipstick, got my make-up on
Stumble into trouble, siren with a sad song
They all got girlfriends, but I’m the one that they want
Miss America, with the blue mascara on

[Chorus]
I spent my whole life driving in cars with boys
Riding around town, drinking in the white noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go
Now we know, baby, now we know
I spent my whole life wasted in bars with boys
Playing rock 'n' roll, dancing in the loud noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go
Now we know, baby, now we know

[Verse 3]
Mommy's Mercedes or Billy's pickup truck
Come home late at night and baby picks me up
Tell him just drive on and d-don't ever stop
Don't take me home again, take me to a new land

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I wear my red lipstick, got my coat and gun
I'm Miss America, now I'm gone, baby, gone
[Pre-Chorus 2: Demo Version]
I wear my red lipstick, grab my coat and gun
Wonder if this is it, it's darkest before dawn
Sometimes I wanna give in, but I just have to go on
Miss America, now I’m gone, baby, gone

[Chorus]
I spent my whole life driving in cars with boys
Riding around town, drinking in the white noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go
Now we know, baby, now we know
I spent my whole life wasted in bars with boys
Playing rock 'n' roll, dancing in the loud noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go
Now we know, baby, now we know

[Bridge]
I was born to live fast, die young
Leave a beautiful corpse, live my life on the run
I got my cash and my Louis Vuitton, diamonds and guns
Girls just wanna, just wanna have fun

[Chorus - Shortened]
I spent my whole life driving in cars with boys
Riding 'round town drinking in the white noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go

[Chorus]
I spent my whole life driving in cars with boys
Riding around town, drinking in the white noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go
Now we know, baby, now we know
I spent my whole life wasted in bars with boys
Playing rock 'n' roll, dancing in the loud noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go
Now we know, baby, now we know


Title: Dum Dum

Lyrics:
[Intro]
Once you've had something, something so beautiful
You'll never be the same

[Verse 1]
I'm a wild child, bright child, knockin' at your door
You thought that you were done but now you want me even more
Dum dum
You want me even more
Dum dum

[Verse 2]
I'm a star child, big smile, living in L.A
I'm coming over, baby, you can't go to school today
Dum dum
Go to school today
Dum dum

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I belong to a bygone era
Like the Scarlett O'Hara of the downtown scene
'Cause I just wanna dream, I just wanna drink
I'm a pop-blues singer, fam-bam zinger
Mansfield ringer from the Hollywood silver screen, silver screen

[Chorus]
Once you've had something, something so beautiful
You'll never be the same
Once you've had a taste of living my way
You'll be forever changed

[Verse 3]
I'm a wild child, sky high, lyin' on your floor
I know I had a lot, but baby wants a little more
Dum dum
Want a little more
Dum dum

[Verse 4]
In my white mink, pink cigarettes from the store
We're making robberies from Tijuana to the shore
Dum dum
'Juana to the shore
Dum dum

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I belong to a bygone era
Like the Bugsy Malone of the deep Sahara
'Cause I'm on the scene, yeah, I'm on the scene
I'm a bad jazz singer, givin' you the finger
No matter what, you'll linger
'Cause you like me even when I'm mean, I'm the queen

[Chorus]
Once you've had something, something so beautiful
You'll never be the same
Once you've had a taste of living my way
You'll be forever changed
Once you've had something, something so beautiful
You'll never be the same
Once you've had a taste of living my way
You'll be forever changed


Title: Dynamite

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
French vanilla ice cream
Just the way I like
Dripping on your windscreen
I can’t get a bite
Guess we could be more than friends
‘Cause this kiss won’t end
And you got me tremblin’

[Chorus]
You’re dynamite
I’m ready to blow
Take me out tonight
You’re dynamite
I’m ready to go
Touch me to ignite
Boy, you’re a wild thing
Rockin' on my heartstrings
I can see the stars collide
Baby, hold me tight
Oh, you’re dynamite

[Verse 2]
Speedin' through the wasteland
Sparkling in the lights
Roll up to the boardwalk
Derelict delight
Eyes all on my dress again
I know how this ends
Boy, you’re all adrenaline

[Chorus]
You’re dynamite
I’m ready to blow
Take me out tonight
You’re dynamite
I’m ready to go
Touch me to ignite
Boy, you’re a wild thing
Rockin' on my heartstrings
I can see the stars collide
Baby, hold me tight
Oh, you’re dynamite

[Bridge]
He’s not like other guys
I can’t apologize
For what my body wants
And what my heart decides
O-Ohh
‘Cause I’m so close to the real thing
Yeah, I’m so close to the real thing
I’m so close to the real thing
I could almost die

[Verse 4]
Say it isn’t over
Say it’s not goodnight
Maybe we could go somewhere
Start a pillow fight

[Chorus]
You’re dynamite
I’m ready to blow
Take me out tonight
You’re dynamite
I’m ready to go
Touch me to ignite
Boy, you’re a wild thing
Rockin' on my heartstrings
I can see the stars collide
Baby, hold me tight
Oh, you’re dynamite
You’re dynamite
I’m ready to blow
Take me out tonight
You’re dynamite
I’m ready to go
Touch me to ignite
Boy, you’re a wild thing
Rockin' on my heartstrings
I can see the stars collide
Baby, hold me tight
Oh, you’re dynamite


Title: Earthquakes

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Earthquakes happen regularly down in California
Walls shake, but I don't move, I put the record on and enjoy it
I dance, dancin' in my underwear, I let the '70s rock and roll me
Laurel Canyon, can you feel my power?
Overdose on opium, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]

Just say goodbye to the sweet Pacific
Goodbye to your lonely queen

Title: Elvis

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Platinum and vale acrylics
Skim the paper for the critics
Baby's breathing Elvis lyrics
On the copper bar
Late in motel lounges singing
Spotlight on the band is swinging
Chateau Marmont memories fading
Hope is very far

[Chorus]
Elvis, where are you when I need you most?
White comp sequin jumpsuit ghost
Pick me up and make a toast
Champagne in the air
Tipping back his head, relaxing
"Thank you very much" and I'm laughing
All my chantilly lace catching
Baby, on the chandelier

[Verse 2]
Sweeping scents and blue hydrangea
Summer hail and summer stranger
Baby, he's in constant danger
Help is very far
You look like a Florida native
"Are you?" I said, at the rate of
Slow molasses from the state of
Vermont with a Southern drawl

[Chorus]
Elvis, where are you when I need you most?
White comp sequin jumpsuit ghost
Pick me up and make a toast
Champagne in the air
Tipping back his head, relaxing
"Thank you very much" and I'm laughing
All my chantilly lace is catching
On the chandelier

[Bridge]
He said he'd come to welcome, warn me
Just your diamond to adorn me
Come to be and see the one and only
For my final year
Well, thank you

[Chorus]
Elvis, where are you when I need you most?
White comp sequin jumpsuit ghost
Pick me up and make a toast
Champagne in the air
Tipping back his head, relaxing
"Thank you very much" and I'm laughing
All my chantilly lace is catching
On the chandelier
It's catching on that chandelier
It's catching on that chandelier
Where are you when I need you most?


Title: End of the World

Lyrics:
Why does the sun go on shining?
Why does the sea rush to shore ?
Don't they know it's the end of the world
Cause you don't love me any more

Why do the birds go on singing?
Why do the stars glow above?
Don't they know it's the end of the world
It ended when I lost your love

I wake up in the morning and I wonder
Why everything's the same as it was
I can't understand, no, I can't understand
How life goes on the way it does...
Why does my heart go on beating?
Why do these eyes of mine cry?
Don't they know it's the end of the world
It ended when you said goodbye

Why does my heart go on beating?
Why do these eyes of mine cry?
Don't they know it's the end of the world
It ended when you said goodbye...


Title: Every Girl Gets Her Wish

Lyrics:
[Intro]
You can whistle for it

[Verse 1]
Baby, you'll never grow old in my eyes
Wit' your golden grill, true love never dies
You wanna watch me while I watch TV
While you're t-t-t-t-touchin' me
We're forever young in paradise
As long as you've got a Chevrolet, I'll ride

[Pre-Chorus]
We're gonna party like it's 1949
Ride in that Chevrolet from July till July
Gonna see it all before she says goodbye
Every girl deserves to see the sun rise

[Chorus]
Every girl gets her wish
Every girl gets her wish
You told me this
Where is mine?

[Verse 2]
You said I'd never make it outta here alive
With the rate I was goin', I'd be lucky to die
I was born so bad, not naturally right
The brightest star on Hollywood and Vine

[Pre-Chorus]
We're gonna party like we're running out of time
We're getting drunk and driving fast on cherry wine
Never do belong to anyone I find
Leaving everything I ever knew behind

[Chorus]
Every girl gets her wish
Every girl gets her wish
You told me this
Where is mine?
Every girl gets her wish
Every girl gets her wish
Promised me this
Well, you lied

[Bridge]
I learned how to make love from the movies
She found me waitressing at Ruby Tuesday's
She said I wanna buy you a classic white milkshake
I said, I'll serve you up a special side of heartbreak
Special side of heartbreak
I was working down at the corner cafe
You drove by in a Chevrolet
Whistle at me as my hips go sway
Lana Del Rey, how you get that way?
How you get that way?
And I said
She loves my heart-shaped sunglasses
She loves the heart shape my ass is
Cristal, crystal champagne glasses

[Chorus]
Every girl gets her wish
Every girl gets her wish
You told me this
Where is mine?
Every girl gets her wish
Every girl gets her wish
Promised me this
Well, you lied


Title: Every Man Gets His Wish

Lyrics:
[Intro]
You can whistle for it

[Verse 1]
Baby, you'll never grow old in my eyes
With your golden grill, true love never dies
You wanna watch me while I watch TV
While you're t-t-t-t-touching me
We're forever young in paradise
As long as you got the Chevrolet, I will ride

[Pre-Chorus]
We're gonna party like it's 1949
We're in that Chevrolet from July to July
Gonna see it all before he says goodbye
Every man deserves to see the sunrise

[Chorus]
"Every man gets his wish"
"Every man gets his wish"
You told me this
Where is mine?

[Verse 2]
You said I'd never make it out outta here alive
At the rate I was going, I'd be lucky to die
I was born so bad, not naturally right
The brightest star on Hollywood and Vine

[Pre-Chorus]
We're gonna party like we're running outta time
We're getting drunk and driving fast on cherry wine
Never do belong to anyone I find
Leaving everything I ever knew behind

[Chorus]
"Every man gets his wish"
"Every man gets his wish"
You told me this
Where is mine?
"Every man gets his wish"
"Every man gets his wish"
Promised me this
Well, you lied

[Bridge]
I learned how to make love from the movies
He found me waitressing at Ruby Tuesday's
He said "I wanna buy you a classic white milkshake"
I said "I'll serve you up a special side of heartbreak"
Special side of heartbreak
I was working down in the corner cafe
You drove by in a Chevrolet
Whistle at me as my hips go sway
"Lana Del Rey, how you get that way?"
How you get that way?
I said "He loves my heart shaped sunglasses
He loves the heart shape my ass is
Cristal, crystal champagne glasses"

[Chorus]
"Every man gets his wish"
"Every man gets his wish"
You told me this
Where is mine?
"Every man gets his wish"
"Every man gets his wish"
Promised me this
Well, you lied


Title: Everything I Do

Lyrics:
[Snippet]
Cali is hot
But none of that matters to me now
New York was home and now it's not


Title: Eye On You

Lyrics:
Eye On You


Title: Fake Diamond

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
You're like a fake diamond
Sparklin' when the lights are on
But when the nighttime comes
And all the lights go off
You turn off with them
(Where do you go when the lights turn low boy?)
You're like an old film reel
Kissing me when the crowd can watch
But when the velvet falls
And the projector coughs
I can be sure you're gone
(You say it's not true but I know how you do, boy)
[Chorus]
I'm like a child who belongs to nobody
So I wear you like my clothes
Hold you close to my body
Because you hurt so good
But you feel so bad honey
I just want you to want me
Want you to want me

[Verse 2]
You're like a fake diamond
Sparkling in the moon and sun
You shine like the only one
But when the darkness comes
Baby, you're on the run
(Where do you go when the lights turn low boy?)
You're like my ex-boyfriend
Kissin' me when the camera's on
I'm candy for your arm
Look like a debutante
But I'm not what you want
(You say it's not true but I know how you do, boy)

[Chorus]
I'm like a child who belongs to nobody
So I wear you like my clothes
Hold you close to my body
Because you hurt so good
But you feel so bad honey
I just want you to want me
Want you to want me
I'm like a child who belongs to nobody
So I wear you like my clothes
Hold you close to my body
Because you hurt so good
But you feel so bad honey
I just want you to want me
Want you to want me

[Bridge]
Baby I can hold you tight
Let me love you right
In the middle of the night
I don't wanna fight
Give it to me
Sing it to me
Show me the light
(You say it's not true, but I know how you do, boy)

[Chorus]
I'm like a child who belongs to nobody
So I wear you like my clothes
Hold you close to my body
Because you hurt so good
But you feel so bad honey
I just want you to want me
Want you to want me
I'm like a child who belongs to nobody
So I wear you like my clothes
Hold you close to my body
Because you hurt so good
But you feel so bad honey
I just want you to want me
Want you to want me


Title: Find My Own Way

Lyrics:
Snow is coming down like rain
I'm at it myself again
A little tired, even more confused

Come on, baby, don't be shy
You can say what make you high
I see the way you be lying, be abused

I don't need anybody when I'm down
I don't really find it hard to get around
I'll find my own way back to town
Oh, don't you tell me how I need to be
That ain't up to anybody else but me
I don't care what you think

Breathing getting fast again
Now I'll start my worrying
When will I learn that there ain’t nothing I can do?

Jesus was a dying man
If he can't do it, no one can
When will you learn that we ain't nothing without you?

We don't need anybody when we're down
We don't really find it hard to get around
We'll find our own way back to town
And oh, don't you tell us how we need to be
That ain't up to anybody else but me
We don't, we don't care what you think

I don't need anybody when I'm down
I don't really find it hard to get around
I'll find my own way back to town
Oh, don't you tell me how I need to be
That ain't up to anybody but me
And I don't care what you think


Title: Fine China

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I wore diamonds for the birth of your baby
For the birth of your son
On the same day, my husband-to-be
Packed his things to run
Was bittersweet to say the least
One life begins, one comes undone
I've always been a strong woman of faith
Strong like a tree, but the unlucky one

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm going down now
With all of my

[Chorus]
Fine china and fresh linen
All of my dresses with them tags still on them
Fine china and dull silver
My white horses and my ivory almonds
I guess they really got the best of us, didn't they?
They said that love was enough, but it wasn't
The Earth shattered, the sky opened
The rain was fire, but we were wooden

[Verse 2]
I wore diamonds for the day of our wedding
For our day in the sun
On the same day, my mother-to-be said she wouldn't come
It's always been that way with me
No time for change, no time for fun
It's always been that way, it seems
One love begins, one comes undone

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm going down now
With all of my

[Chorus]
Fine china and fresh linen
All of my dresses with them tags still on them
Fine china and dull silver
My white horses and my ivory almonds
I guess they really got the best of us, didn't they?
They said that love was enough, but it wasn't
The Earth shattered, the sky opened
The rain was fire, but we were wooden

[Bridge]
All of my, all of my fine china
All of my, all of my fine china
All of my, all of my fine china
Blue, ah, blue
All of my, all of my fine china
All of my, all of my fine china
All of my, all of my fine china
Blue, ah

[Chorus]
Fine china and fresh linen
All of my dresses with them tags still on them
Fine china and dull silver
My white horses and my ivory almonds
I guess they really got the best of us, didn't they?
They said that love was enough, but it wasn't
The Earth shattered, the sky opened
The rain was fire, but we were wooden

[Outro]
Fine china, fine china, fine china
Fresh linen, fresh linen, fresh linen
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

Title: Fingertips

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
When I look back, tracing fingertips over plastic bags
Thinking, "I wish I could extrapolate some small intention
Or maybe just get your attention for a minute or two"

[Verse 2]
Will I die? Or will I get to that ten-year mark?
Where I beat the extinction of telomeres?
And if I do, will you be there with me, Father, Sister, Brother?

[Verse 3]
Charlie, stop smoking
Caroline, will you be with me?
Will the baby be alright?
Will I have one of mine?
Can I handle it even if I do?
It's said that my mind
Is not fit, or so they said, to carry a child
I guess I'll be fine

[Verse 4]
It wasn't my idea, the cocktail of things that twists neurons inside
But without them, I'd die
They say there's irony in the music, it's a tragedy, I
See nothing Greek in it
Give me a mausoleum in Rhode Island with Dad, Grandma, Grandpa, and Dave
Who hung himself real high
In the National Park sky, it's a shame and I'm crying right now
To get to you, save you, if I take my life
Find your astral body, put it into my arms
Give you two seconds to cry
Take you home, I, I'll give you a blanket
Your spirit can sit and watch TV by my side
'Cause, baby, I
Ran through a time when I felt you were doing it

[Verse 5]
I couldn't handle it, I was in Monaco
I couldn't hear what they said on the telephone
I had to sing for the prince in two hours
Sat in the shower
Gave myself two seconds to cry
It's a shame that we die

[Verse 6]
When I was fifteen, naked, next-door neighbors did a drive-by
Pulled me up by my waist, long hair to the beach side
I wanted to go out like you, swim with the fishes
That he caught on Rhode Island beaches
But, sometimes, it's just not your time
[Verse 7]
Caroline, what kind of mother was she to say I'd end up in institutions?
All I wanted to do was kiss Aaron Greene and sit by
The lake, twisting lime into the drinks that they made
Have a babe at sixteen in the town I was born in, and die

[Verse 8]
Aaron ended up dead and not me
What the fuck's wrong in your head to send me away, never to come back?
Exotic places and people don't take the place of being your child
I give myself two seconds to cry

[Verse 9]
Let it crash over me
Like the waves in the sea
Call me Aphrodite, as they bow down to me

[Verse 10]
Sunbather, moon chaser, queen of empathy
I give myself two seconds to breathe
And go back to being a serene queen
I just needed two seconds to be me


Title: Fishtail

Lyrics:
[Intro]
Don't you dare say that you'll braid my hair, babe
If you don't really care
You wanted me sadder, you wanted me sadder
Fishtail, what's the matter with that?

[Verse 1]
Skippin' rope in the bayou, bayou
Slip softly in terrain
Not that smart, but I've got things to say
Palm trees in black and white
I like to watch them sway
You're so funny, I wish I could skinny-dip inside your mind
[Pre-Chorus]
Lately, I've been thinkin' about how things used to be
Swingin' in a nightgown underneath the old oak tree
Almost Victorian with you, you can talk to me
But, lately, I can see

[Chorus]
You wanted me sadder (Baby)
You wanted me sadder
Can't you see it?
For me, you are the one
And if I'm not the one for you, don't just say it
I was on the stairs, Ella Fitzgerald in the air
Feelin' hella rare
Baby, if you care
Baby, don't you dare say
You'll braid my hair, babe
Don't you dare say that you'll braid my hair, babe
If you don't really care
You wanted me sadder

[Verse 2]
Dancin' there in the hot, hot sun
I know that we've got problems
I plan to address them another day
Palm trees in black and white
I see in technicolor
Maybe I'll take my glasses off so I stop painting red flags green

[Pre-Chorus]
Lately, I've been sunnin' in the L.A. riverbed
Wearin' nothin' but the summer bruises on my knees
I like how you talk, how you speak, how you look at me
But, lately, I can see

[Chorus]
You wanted me sadder (Baby)
You wanted me sadder
You wanted me sadder
Can't you see it?
For me, you are the one and if I'm not the one for you
Don't just say it
I was on the stairs, Ella Fitzgerald in the air
Feelin' hella rare
Baby, if you care
Baby, don't you dare say
You'll braid my hair, see
Baby, if you care, then
Baby, don't you dare say
That you really care
Don't you dare say that you'll braid my hair
When you get home tonight
If you don't really care
Yeah, don't you dare say that you'll braid my hair, babe
If you don't really care, see
Don't you braid my hair
If you're not coming home to me
Ah-ah

[Outro]
You want someone sadder
Skippin' rope in the bayou, bayou
Slip softly in terrain
I'm not that smart
But I've got things to say


Title: FLB&W (Snippet)

Lyrics:
[Intro]
Cum shot, cum shot, in my crotch, my crotch
Cum shot, cum shot, in my crotch, my crotch
Cum shot, cum shot, in my crotch, my crotch
Cum shot, cum shot, in my crotch, my crotch
Cum shot, cum shot! In my crotch, my crotch!

[Verse 1]
I haven't peed on the dick since I was nine
I haven't smelled like sardine in a long, long time
I mean, look at me
Look at the length of my pubic hair, and my face, the shape of my pussy
Do you really think I give a fuck
What I do after years of just hearing them jacking off?

[Pre-Chorus]
I say I live in Niagara Fall, really, I'm at Wet Vagina
It doesn't really matter, doesn't really fucking matter

[Chorus]
Call him up, “Squirt into my bootyhole"
No cheap hotels, you taking me to the Hyatt
Eating that dick for dinner for me cheating on my diet
It's not about havin' someone to hump me anymore
This is the experience of bein' a freak lil' bitch whore
(Gasm, ahh, whore, uh)

[Verse 2]
Called up one bitch, called up another
Bill Cosby wasn't on
Watching Peter Griffin and Stewie Wondering what went wrong
Way past a freak, I’m more like disgusting
Pussy taste sweeter than sweet potato pumpkins
Stay ass-naked clothes haven’t been worn
Squeezing my pussy then it drip like getting juice out a orange

[Pre-Chorus]
I say I live in Niagara Fall, really, I'm at Wet Vagina
It doesn't really matter, doesn't really fucking matter

[Chorus]
Call him up, "Come daddy and hurt this"
Drop something pick it up slow on purpose, but, ah-augh
It's not about havin' someone to hump me anymore
No, this is the experience of bein' a freak lil' bitch whore (Gasm, ahh)

[Verse 3]
I mean look at my pubic hair
Look at the length of it and the shape of my pussy
If I told you he touched me in a spot that made me hot
Do you really think that anybody would think
I didn't ask for dick? I didn't ask for dick
Don’t test me unless it’s with your testicles
On top of this, mm, so many other tricks that's worth it
Did you know a pornstar can still be
Looking like a young twat at thirty-three?
God's a midget, don't look back babe
Puts the shower on while he calls me
Slips out the back door to talk to me
(I'm invisible, look how he holds)


Title: Flipside

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Are you gonna hurt me now?
Or are you gonna hurt me later?
Are you gonna go to town?
Maybe you should play it safer
You've got me all dressed up tonight
Springsteen on the radio
You've got me all freaked out tonight
Somethin' you're telling me, what? I don't know

[Chorus]
You don't wanna break me down
You don't wanna say goodbye and
You don't wanna turn around
You don't wanna make me cry, but
You caught me once
​Maybe on the flipside I could catch you again
You caught me once
​Maybe on the flipside you could catch me again

[Post-Chorus]
Drinks on the patio

[Verse 2]
Are you gonna tell me now?
Are you gonna tell me later?
'Cause if you think that I don't know
I'm gonna have to say you're crazy
I'm getting all dressed up tonight
Dressed up just to hear you, boy
I already know what you got in store
Why I go? Baby, I don't know

[Chorus]
'Cause you don't wanna break me down
You don't wanna say goodbye and
You don't wanna turn around
You don't wanna make me cry, but
You caught me once
​Maybe on the flipside I could catch you again
You caught me once
​Maybe on the flipside you could catch me again

[Bridge]
So you think you're in charge?
Do you?
Acting like a big shot
I'm sure
So you think you're in charge?
Do you?
You're acting like a big shot

[Chorus]
You don't wanna break me down
You don't wanna say goodbye and
You don't wanna turn around
You don't wanna make me cry but
You caught me once
​Maybe on the flipside I could catch you again
You caught me once
​Maybe on the flipside you could catch me again


Title: Florida Kilos

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
White lines, pretty baby, tattoos
Don't know what they mean, they're special, just for you
White lines, baking powder on the stove
Cooking up a dream, turning diamonds into snow

I feel you, pretty baby, feel me
Turn it up hot, loving you is free
I like it down, like it down way low
But you already know that, you already know
(Fuck!)

[Pre-Chorus]
Come on down to Florida
I got something for ya
We could see the kilos or the Keys, baby, oh yeah
Guns in the summertime
Chic-a-Cherry Cola lime
Prison isn't nothing to me if you'll be by my side

[Chorus]
Yayo, yayo, yayo
And all the dope fiends
Yayo, yayo, yayo
(Fuck!)

[Verse 2]
Sun in my mouth and gold hoops
You like your little baby, like you like your drinks: cool
White lines, pretty daddy, go skiing
You snort it like a champ, like the winter we’re not in
(Fuck!)

[Pre-Chorus]
Come on down to Florida
I got something for ya
We could see the kilos or the Keys, baby, oh yeah
Guns in the summertime
Chic-a-Cherry Cola lime
Prison isn't nothing to me if you'll be by my side

[Chorus]
Yayo, yayo, yayo
And all the dope fiends
Yayo, yayo, yayo
(Fuck!)

[Bridge]
We could get high in Miami, ooh, ooh
Dance the night away
People never die in Miami, ooh, ooh
That's what they all say yay
(You believe me, don't you baby?)

[Pre-Chorus]
Come on down to Florida
I got something for ya
We could see the kilos or the Keys, baby, oh yeah
Guns in the summertime
Chic-a-Cherry Cola lime
Prison don't mean nothing to me if you'll be by my side

[Chorus]
Yayo, yayo, yayo
All the Floridians like
Yayo, yayo, yayo
All the Colombians like
Yayo, yayo, yayo
And all my girlfriends
Yayo, yayo, yayo

White lines, pretty baby
Gold teeth, pretty baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Dance the night away

None


Title: Fordham Road

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Thirty blocks to Fordham Road
That’s a bad neighborhood
Crack house on the corner
I know I shouldn’t do what it is I could

[Verse 2]
The stone Mary in the garden
She let me know she watching
And she said I better get walking
I better walk away

[Chorus]
I don’t know why it is that I wanna stay
I don’t know what it is that makes me feel this way
But I’m not gonna do what I hear me say
I’m just gonna walk, I’m gonna walk away

[Verse 3]
I catch a dollar in the wind and I
Buy a cup of coffee
There’s a place on Valentine
That still charge ninety cent
I keep on walking in the daytime
And in my eyes, it’s always nighttime
And I like it when it’s me at night
‘Cause that’s when all the stars come out
Oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh

[Chorus]
I don't know why it is that I wanna stay
I don't know what it is that makes me feel this way
But I'm not gonna do what I hear me say, oh
I'm just gonna walk, I'm gonna walk away

[Bridge]
It's the greatest, it's the greatest day
It's the greatest, it's the greatest day, oh

[Outro]
I'm not gonna do what I hear me say
I'm just gonna walk, I'm gonna walk away


Title: For Free

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Zella Day]
I slept last night in a good hotel
I went shoppin' today for jewels
The wind rushed around in the dirty town
And the children let out from their school
I was standin' on a noisy corner
Waitin' for the walkin' green
Across the street, he stood
And he played real good
On his clarinet for free

[Verse 2: Lana Del Rey]
Now me, I play for fortunes
And those velvet curtain calls
I've got a black Limousine and two gentlemen
Who escort me through these halls
And I'll play if you've got the money
Or if you're a friend to me
But the one-man band by thе quick lunch stand
He's been playin' real good for free

[Verse 3: Weyes Blood]
Nobody stopped to hеar him
Though he played so sweet and high
They knew he had never been on the TV
So they passed his music by
I meant to go over and ask for a song
Maybe put on a harmony
I heard his refrain as the signal changed
He was playin' real good for free


Title: For K, Pt. 2

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Alright, you caught me I don't play a good guitar but
What do you want from me? It's just a stupid bar
I didn't promise anythin', no, mmm-mmm
You think I'm pretty and you like the way I talk
I like your music and you like the way I walk, so
I think we're gonna get along, mmm-hmm
I like the way you wear your sweater off your shoulder
The way your hair come down, it make you look older
How you get so handsome, my boy?
Oh, mmm

[Chorus]
Pretty baby
Pretty baby
How?

[Verse 2]
The way your face is shaped, I wonder if you know
The way you stand up and your silhouette glows
I'm electrified, I'll be up all night now
Mmm, yeah-yeah, yeah
Use that voice, sing that song
And tell me to come on, to come on, come on
You won't hear no, you won't hear no
Mmm-mmm

[Chorus]
Pretty baby
Pretty baby
How?
Pretty baby


Title: For You

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
All these feelings I'm tired of them
Ruling over my life again
Emotions aren't my friend
I keep them ordered as best I can

[Chorus]
I can, you can, we can do
Can keep it all together
Layman, workman, his man, her man
How about about the weather?

[Verse 2]
All these people I'm tired of them
Sifting into my life again
Their questions, the "how and when"
I try and answer the best that I can but

[Chorus]
I can, you can, we can do
Can keep it all together
Layman, workman, his man, her man
How about about the weather?

[Verse 3]
All my worries, they come and go
They tend to leave when I let you know
On bad days I take it slow
I try to dance when I hit a low

[Chorus]
I can, you can, we can do
Can keep it all together
Hit man, burn man, his man, her man
It will all get better

[Verse 4]
Oh, the days they go so fast
I can't believe what is in my past
The future's here at last
I don't need to have what she has

[Chorus]
I can, you can, we can do
Can keep it all together
Hit man, burn man, his man, her man
It will all get better

[Bridge]
Sing it out, sing it loud
Sing it out, sing it loud
Be proud, come out
Be proud, come out

[Chorus]
I can, you can, we can do
Can keep it all together
Hit man, burn man, his man, her man
We can make it better, yeah
We will have it better


Title: Freak

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Flames so hot that they turn blue
Palms reflecting in your eyes
Like an endless summer
That's the way I feel for you
If time stood still, I'd take this moment, make it last forever

[Pre-Chorus]
Your halo's full of fire
I'm rising up, rising up
My hot love's full of fire
Love's full of fire
La, ah
[Chorus]
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too
Screw your anonymity, loving me is all you need
To feel like I do
We could slow dance to rock music, kiss while we do it
Talk 'til we both turn blue
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too

[Verse 2]
Leather black and eyes of blue (Blue, blue, blue)
Sun reflecting in your eyes
Like an easy rider
Life makes sense when I'm with you
Looking back, my past
It all seems stranger than a stranger

[Pre-Chorus]
So let's dance in slow motion
Tear it up, tear it up
And let's dance by the ocean
Ah, ah

[Chorus]
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California (Hmm-hmm-mmm-mmm)
Be a freak like me, too
Screw your anonymity, loving me is all you need (Hmm-hmm-mmm-mmm)
To feel like I do
We could slow dance to rock music, kiss while we do it
Talk 'til we both turn blue
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California (Hmm-hmm-mmm-mmm)
Be a freak like me, too

[Bridge]
Ooh-ooh
You're cold as ice, baby
But when you're nice, baby
You're so amazing in every way
Ooh-ooh
You're cold as ice, baby
I don't wanna fight, baby
It's like I told you
If you stay, I'll stay (yeah)

[Chorus]
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California (Hmm-hmm-mmm-mmm)
Be a freak like me, too
(Take it to the back if you really wanna talk)
Screw your anonymity, loving me is all you need
To feel like I do
(Take it to the back if you really wanna talk)
We could slow dance to rock music, kiss while we do it
Talk 'til we both turn blue
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California (Hmm-hmm-mmm-mmm)
Be a freak like me, too

[Outro]
Hmm-hmm-mmm-mmm


Title: French Restaurant

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Hit the streets, city beat
I know what you want
Talk to me softly
French restaurant
Every time I turn around
I look at you like what now
I'm telling you, it's all true

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm talking to him while I'm thinking of you
I'm trying my best, I don't know what to do
Talking to you, don't know what it's about

I know they think that I have everything
If I can't have you, then they can't have me
(I know it looks like I have everything)
If I can't have you, then they can't have me

Why am I crying on the balcony?

If I can't have you, then they can't havе me
(Honestly)

[Verse 2]
Super cool, swimming pool
Will you paint mе sweet?

Can't one single thing
Be just what it appears to be?

I'm talking to him while I'm thinking of you
I'm trying my best, I don't know what to do
Talking to him, I don't know what it's about

If I can't have you, then they can't have me

If I can't have you, then they can't have me
(I know they think that I have everything)
Why am I crying on the balcony?

If I can't have you then they can't have me
(Honestly)

[Outro]
I know they think that I have everything
If I can't have you, then they can't have me
I know it looks like I have everything
If I can't have you, then they can't have me

Title: Fuck it I love you

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I like to see everything in neon
Drink  lime green, stay up 'til dawn
Maybe  the way that I'm living is killing me
I like to light up the stage with a song
Do shit to keep me turned on
But  one day I woke up like
"Maybe  I'll do it differently"

[Pre-Chorus]
So I moved to California‚ but it's just a state of mind
It  turns out everywhere you go‚ you take yourself‚ that's not a lie
Wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
It's killing me slowly

[Chorus]
Dream a little dream of me
Make  me into something sweet
Turn the radio on, dancing to a pop song
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it‚ I love you
Fuck it, I love you
I really do

[Verse 2]
I used to shoot up my veins in neon
And shit's even brighter; you're gone
So many things I would say to you
I want you

[Pre-Chorus]
You moved to California, but it's just a state of mind
And you know everyone adores you
You can't feel it and you're tired
Baby‚ wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
But it's killing me slowly

[Chorus]
Dream a little dream of me
Turn this into something sweet
Turn the radio on, dancing to a pop song
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it, I love you
I really do

[Bridge]
It turns out California's more than just a state of mind
I met you on the boulevard, braids in my hair, you blew my mind
And if I wasn't so fucked up, I think I'd fuck you all the time
(I really do)
It's killing me slowly

[Chorus]
Fuck it, I love you (I moved to California, but it's just a state of mind)
Fuck it, I love you (It turns out everywhere you go, you take yourself, that's not a lie)
Fuck it, I love you (Wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine)
I really do (It's killing me slowly)

[Outro]
(Fuck it, I love you)
California dreamin', got my money on my mind
(Fuck it, I love you)
Jazz in my veins, running out of time
(Fuck it, I love you)
California dreamin', got my money on my mind
(I really do)
Jazz in my veins, running out of time
(Fuck it, I love you)
California dreamin', got my money on my mind
(Fuck it, I love you)
Jazz in my veins, running out of time
(Fuck it, I love you)
California dreamin', got my money on my mind
(I really do)
Jazz in my veins, running out of time

Title: Get Free

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Finally, I'm crossing the threshold
From the ordinary world
To the reveal of my heart
Undoubtedly, that will for certain
Take the dead out of the sea
And the darkness from the arts

[Pre-Chorus]
This is my commitment, my modern manifesto
I'm doin' it for all of us who never got the chance
For and for (Shut up, shut up)
And all my birds of paradise (Shut up, shut up)
Who never got to fly at night (Shut up, shut up)
'Cause they were caught up in the dance

[Chorus]
Sometimes, it feels like I've got a war in my mind
I wanna get off, but I keep ridin' the ride
I never really noticed that I had to decide
To play someone's game or live my own life
And now I do, I wanna move
Out of the black (Out of the black) into the blue (Into the blue)

[Verse 2]
Finally, gone is the burden
Of the Crowley way of bein'
That comes from energies combined
Like my part was, I was not discernin'
And you, as we found out
Were not in your right mind

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no more chasing rainbows and hoping for an end to them
Their arches are illusions, solid at first glance
But then you try to touch them (Touch, touch)
There's nothing to hold on to (Shut up, shut up)
The colors used to lure you in (Shut up, shut up)
And put you in a trance (Ah, yeah)

[Chorus]
Sometimes, it feels like I've got a war in my mind
I wanna get off, but I keep ridin' the ride
I never really noticed that I had to decide
To play someone's game or live my own life
And now I do, I wanna move
Out of the black (Out of the black) into the blue (Into the blue)

[Post-Chorus]
Out of the black (Out of the black) into the blue (Into the blue)
Out of the black (Out of the black) into the blue (Into the blue)

Title: Gloria (MTV Unplugged)

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Lana Del Rey & Mando Diao]
Well now
She don't need to see the sun ahead
Don’t need that help from God above
If you're losing her, don't be sad
Cause she will offer you heart attacks
She’s tired of problems that you caused her mind
Tired of all those lies in your freak show
Tired of being alone at night
Being the lowest cat on earth

[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey & Mando Diao]
So Gloria steps out of the prison
Gloria's no longer the wasted disco girl
You've been dreaming about

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey & Mando Diao]
Gloria, alone now forever
Gloria, away in the air now
Gloria, she's no longer your slavе
No, no, not anymore, no, you know what I'm talking about

[Verse 2: Lana Del Rey & Mando Diao]
Well, well, wеll
It's time for you to see yourself
All the misery you brought up
Gloria's one day ahead
Watching you from the heaven's gate
She’s tired of problems that you caused her mind
Tired of all those lies in your freak show
Tired of being alone at night
Being the lowest cat on Earth

[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey & Mando Diao]
So Gloria steps out of the prison
Gloria’s no longer the wasted disco girl
That you've been dreaming about
No

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey & Mando Diao]

Gloria steps out from the prison
Gloria's no longer the wasted disco girl
You've been dreaming about

No, no, no, not anymore, you know what I mean
Not anymore, not anymore, not anymore, not anymore
Not anymore
Yeah, oh, yeah

God knows I tried
God knows I tried

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, I wake up in the morning
To red, blue, and yellow lights
On Monday, they destroy me
But, by Friday, I'm revived

[Pre-Chorus]
Put on that "Hotel California"
Wear my blinders in the rain
I've got nothing much to live for
Ever since I found my fame

[Chorus]
God knows I lived
God knows I died
God knows I loved
God knows I lied
God knows I begged
Begged, borrowed, and cried
God knows I lost
God gave me life
And God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried

[Bridge]
So let there be light
Let there be light
Light up my life
Light up my life
Let there be light
Let there be light
Light up my life
Light up my life

[Outro]
And God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried


Title: Gods And Monsters

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
In the land of gods and monsters
I was an angel living in the garden of evil
Screwed up, scared, doing anything that I needed
Shining like a fiery beacon

[Pre-Chorus]
You got that medicine I need
Fame, liquor, love, give it to me slowly
Put your hands on my waist, do it softly
Me and God, we don't get along, so now I sing

[Chorus]
No one's gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees, sprees and I'm singing
"Fuck yeah, give it to me, this is﻿ Heaven, what I truly want"
It's innocence lost, innocence lost

[Verse 2]
In the land of gods and monsters
I was an angel looking to get fucked hard
Like a groupie incognito, posing as a real singer
Life imitates art

[Pre-Chorus]
You got that medicine I need
Dope, shoot it up, straight to the heart, please
I don't really wanna know what's good for me
God's dead, I said, "Baby, that's alright with me"

[Chorus]
No one's gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees, sprees and I'm singing
"Fuck yeah, give it to me, this is﻿ Heaven, what I truly want"
It's innocence lost, innocence lost

[Bridge]
When you talk, it's like a movie and you're makin' me crazy
'Cause life imitates art
If I get a little prettier, can I be your baby?
You tell me life isn't that hard

[Chorus]
No one's gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees, sprees and I'm singing
"Fuck yeah, give it to me, this is﻿ Heaven, what I truly want"
It's innocence lost, innocence lost

Title: God Save Our Young Blood

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: BØRNS & Both]
Damn, look at the sunrise
Glowing finish line, made it in record time
Hey, baby, we made it
My head's faded, headlights dilated

[Refrain: BØRNS & Both]
Spinnin', spinnin' and I can't sit still
Spinnin', spinnin' and we can't sit still

Baptized in blue skies
Roll the window down, reach out, feel around for new life
Damn, you and those green eyes
We can never stop movin', we see nothin' but the green lights

Spinnin', spinnin' and we can't sit still
Spinnin', spinnin' and we can't sit still

Hot pavement, hot pavement, hot wheels in the sun
God save our young blood
God save, God save our young blood
God save, God save our young love
Warm waves, warm waves, on the coast where we love
God save our young blood

[Verse 2: BØRNS]
Climbed up the tree of life, kicked out of paradise
Living good, living evil is the toss of the dice
Couple of wild eyes, cup full of high life
She's an angel and a devil of her own device

[Refrain: BØRNS, Lana Del Rey, Both]
She's got me spinnin' (Spinnin')
Spinnin' and I can't sit still (You know I can't sit still)

God save our young blood

[Bridge: BØRNS, Lana Del Rey, Both]
God save the ocean, God save the breeze
Save the words from my lips, save the birds, save the bees
Baby save me one last sip while you strip on the beach
I'll save you in the waves if you swim too deep
God save, God save our young blood
God save our young love

[Chorus: BØRNS & Both]
God save, God save our young blood
God save, God save our young love
Hot pavement, hot pavement, hot wheels in the sun
God save our young blood

On the coast where we love

I drop it like it's hot on the pole, on the pole
Shining in the club, neon gold, neon gold

A little bit of fun for your soul, for your soul
They call me "Firecracker", 'cause ain't nobody faster

Boy, break out your dollars, baby needs a new fur

I'm the girl next door, let me come in
I know I go-go dance but I do it for kicks
I never have to work 'cause my daddy is rich
I'm partyin' all night, shinin' in the lights
Is it a crime to wanna shine
In my white go-go boots and my silver design?
I know it makes you wild
I know it makes you wild

[Chorus]
I'm your go-go dancer, midnight answer
Jukebox sweetheart, queen of the night
Vegas baby, if you pay me
Anything you like, anything you like
Go-go dancer, midnight answer
Jukebox sweetheart, Queen of the night
Vegas baby, if you pay me
Anything you like
Go-go-g-go-go dancer tonight

Title: Goodbye Kiss

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Doomed from the start
We met with a goodbye kiss, I broke my wrist
It all kicked off, I had no choice
You said that you didn't mind 'cause love's hard to find

[Hook]
Maybe the days we had are gone, living in silence for too long
Open your eyes and what do you see?
No more laughs, no more photographs

[Chorus]
Turning slowly, looking back, see
No words, can save this, you're broken and I'm pissed
Run along like I'm supposed to, be the man I ought to
Rock and roll sent us insane
I hope someday that we will meet again

[Verse 2]
Running wild
Giving it everyone, now that's all done

[Hooing, it can't be true
Maybe the days we had are gone, living in silence for too long
Open your eyes and what  you see?
ThNo more laughs, no more photographs

[Chorus]
Turning slowly, looking back, see
No words can save us, you're broken and I'm pissed
Run along like I'm supposed to, be the man I ought to
Rock and roll sent us insane
I hope someday that we will meet again

You go your way and I'll go my way
No words can save us, this lifestyle made us
Run along like I'm supposed to, be the man I ought to
Rock and roll sent us insane
I hope someday that we will meet again

Title: Grandfather please stand on the shoulders of my father while he’s deep-sea fishing

Lyrics:
[Intro]
Three white butterflies to know you're near

[Verse]
I know they think that it took somebody else
To make me beautiful, beautiful
As they intended me to be
But they're wrong
I know they think that it took thousands of people
To put me together again like an experiment
Some big men behind the scenes
Sewing Frankenstein black dreams into my songs
But they're wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
God, if you'rе near me, send mе three white butterflies
Or an owl to know you're listening, sitting while I'm drinking

[Chorus]
Grandfather, please stand on the shoulders of my father
While he's deep-sea fishing for sharks in the Pacific

[Bridge]
'Cause I'm good in spirit, warm-bodied
A fallible deity wrapped up in white
I'm folk, I'm jazz, I'm blue, I'm green
Regrettably, also a white woman
But I have good intentions even if I'm one of the last ones
If you don't believe me, my poetry, or my melodies
Feel it in your bones
I have good intentions even if I'm one of the last ones
(Ah, yeah, ah, yeah, ah, yeah, oh)

[Chorus]
Grandfather, please stand on the shoulders of my father
While he's deep-sea fishing for all the things he's wishing
God, if you're near me, send me three white butterflies
Or a map to know your vision, impart on me your wisdom

[Post-Chorus]
It took somebody else to make me beautiful, wonderful
As they intended me to be
But they're wrong

[Outro]
Three white butterflies to know you're near

Lyrics:
[Intro]
Hey, back in, ah
Baby, come on

[Verse 1]
Are you back in Greenwich, droppin' acid?
Are you at the Archive, watchin' television?
Did you leave for Battery with your weed
And your leather, lookin' like Ray Gillen?
Are you still the king of rock 'n' roll, babe?
Bet you miss hearin' me sing, calling me Lana
And did you take your run today
Along that West Side Highway?
Do you miss your baby mama?

[Chorus]
Blue hydrangea
Will my forever love never come back to me?

[Verse 2]
Does it feel like yesterday to you yet?
How quickly you forget how I made you smile
I remember everything
The diamond horseshoe, wedding ring
And the tile aisle, aisle, aisle

[Chorus]
Blue hydrangea
Will my forever love never return to me?


Title: Greenwich Acid

Lyrics:

How quickly you forget how I made you smile
But I remember everything
That diamond horseshoe, wedding ring
The flowers in my hair, the tile aisle

Will my forever love never return to me?
The apple of my eye, the only one I see
Yes sir, I believe, yes sir, I believe

You're in the bar playin' guitar
I'm tryin' not to let the crowd next to me
It's so hard sometimes with a star
When you have to share him with everybody
You're in the club livin' it up
I'm trying not to let the crowd notice me
It's so sweet swingin' to the beat
When I know that you're doin' it all for me

Taking our dreams, turning them to things
It's like magic, babe, isn't life wonderful? (Mm)

My babe, my babe, stay on my brain (Yeah)
My babe, made me sing to a fire escape

Heavy metal love of mine
I should have learned to let you stay
You didn't want me all the time

Title: Gutta!

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Det er gutta
Du blir kutta
En, to (pow, pow) Legger deg i Kista
Kaos er det jeg har vokst opp med
Kæbene ser, bitch gå ned på kne og se hvordan vi gjør det
Er du heldig, du havner opp på legevakta
Forteller bare fakta, Bitch du blir slakta
Jeg har ingen nåde, brenner deg på bålet, ta rådet
Hvis jeg dør så dør jeg som en legende, det er bare å vente
De ringer meg på telefon, som om jeg var 1881 (Hæ)

[Verse 2]
Bror jeg har alltid vært nummer en
Disse barna snakker gjeng mot gjeng
Svarte hansker, svarte tanker
Slår deg med betong, louis vuitton

Title: Happiness is a butterfly

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Do you want me or do you not?
I heard one thing, now I'm hearing another
Dropped a pin to my parking spot
The bar was hot, it's 2 AM, it feels like summer

[Refrain 1]
Happiness is a butterfly
Try to catch it, like, every night
It escapes from my hands into moonlight
Every day is a lullaby
Hum it on the phone, like, every night
Sing it for my babies on the tour life, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
If he's a serial killer, then what's the worst
That can happen to a girl who's already hurt?
I'm already hurt
If he's as bad as they say, then I guess I'm cursed
Looking into his eyes, I think he's already hurt
He's already hurt

[Chorus]
I said, "Don't be a jerk, don't call me a taxi"
Sitting in your sweatshirt, crying in the backseat, ooh
I just wanna dance with you
Hollywood and Vine, Black Rabbit in the alley
I just wanna hold you tight down the avenue
I just wanna dance with you
I just wanna dance with you

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, I just wanna dance (Dance)
With you (Dance)
Baby, I just wanna dance (Dance)
With you

[Verse 2]
Left the canyon, drove to the club
I was one thing, now I'm being another
Laurel down to Sunset in the truck
I'll pick you up if you're in town on the corner, ah

[Refrain 2]
Happiness is a butterfly
We should catch it while dancing
I lose myself in the music, baby
Every day is a lullaby
Try to catch it like lightning
I sing it into my music, I'm crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
If he's a serial killer, then what's the worst
That can happen to a girl who's already hurt?
I'm already hurt
If he's as bad as they say, then I guess I'm cursed
Looking into his eyes, I think he's already hurt
He's already hurt

[Chorus]
I said, "Don't be a jerk, don't call me a taxi"
Sitting in your sweatshirt, crying in the backseat, ooh
I just wanna dance with you
Hollywood and Vine, Black Rabbit in the alley
I just wanna hold you tight down the avenue
I just wanna dance with you
I just wanna dance with you

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, I just wanna dance (Dance)
With you (Dance)
Baby, I just wanna dance (Dance)
With you


Title: Happy

Lyrics:
You thought I was rich
And I am but not how you think
I live in a Tudor house
Under the freeway in Mar Vista by the beach
When you call I take my phone to the picnic table
That I bought from the Rose Bowl
And I listen to the rushing cars above
And I think about the last time you visited me
The last time we made love
How the noise got louder and louder during rush hour
Until it sounded like the sea
And it felt like the ocean was the sky
And that I was flying because you were two feet taller than me
Until you took me in your arms
And I could touch the stars
And they all fell down around my head
And I became an angel
And you put me to bed
Happy

People think that I'm rich and I am but not how they think
I have a truck with a gold key chain in the ignition
And on the back it says: happy,  joyous, and free
Happy
And when I drive
I think about the last time my friends were driving with me
How the radio was so loud that I couldn't hear the words
So we became the music
Happy

They write that I'm rich and I am but not how they think
I have a safe I call the boyfriend box
And in it every saved receipt
Every movie theater ticket just to remind me
Of all the things I've loved and lost and loved again
Unconditionally
Happy

You joke that I'm rich and I am but not how you think
I live in a Tudor house under the freeway
Off of Rose Avenue, 12 blocks from the beach
And when you call I put your sweater on
And put you on speaker
And chat for hours underneath the trees
And think about the last time you were here lying next to me
How the noise from the cars got louder and louder
During rush hour
Until it sounded like a river or a stream
And it felt like we were swimming
But it wasn't just a dream
We were just

Happy


Title: Happy Birthday, Mr. President

Lyrics:
[Intro]
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday Mr President
Happy birthday to you

[Verse]
Thanks, Mr President
For all the things you've done
The battles that you've won

And our problems by the ton
We thank you so much

Everybody, happy birthday


Title: Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas

Lyrics:
Note: The following are the lyrics of the original song
Lana's version might differ (if it ever resurfaces)

[Verse 1]
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
Next year all our troubles
Will be out of sight

[Verse 2]
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
Next year all our troubles
Will be miles away

[Verse 3]
Once again as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Will be near to us once more

[Outro]
Someday soon we all will be together
If the fates allow
Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow
So have yourself a merry little Christmas now


Title: Hawaiian Tropic

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Hawaiian tropic, dark, and a bottle of jack in the Cadillac
As I drive down the highway
You aren't coming back and I know that now
So I let the wind hit me in my face

[Chorus]
Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish

[Verse 2]
Your red Hawaiian shirt and your hair jet black
Hanging 'round with your friends by the track
Baby, you can't come back from being that bad
Just to sit at home, pledge allegiance to the flag

[Chorus - Variation]
Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, now you're gone

[Verse 3]
Copacabana, yes in my party dress
I’m shimmering in love on that crystal meth
A Coca Cola kid, roller coaster child
You my everything, give me that baby doll smile

[Chorus - Variation 2]
Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, where is mine?
Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, were you lyin'?

[Bridge]
And the velvet Elvis and the rosaries
And your white Corvette under willow trees
You the one for me, my one true king

[Chorus - Variation]
Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, now you're gone
Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, now you're gone

[Verse 4]
I remember party dresses
I remember party dresses

[Outro]
Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
But sometimes it comes too late


Title: Heartbreak Hotel

Lyrics:
Note: The following are the lyrics of the original song
Lana's version might differ (if it ever resurfaces)

[Verse 1]
Well, since my baby left me
Well, I found a new place to dwell
Well, it's down at the end of lonely street
At Heartbreak Hotel

[Chorus]
You make me so lonely baby
Well, I'm so lonely
I get so lonely I could die

[Verse 2]
Although it's always crowded
You still can find some room
For broken hearted lovers
To cry away their gloom
And be so

[Chorus]
You make me so lonely baby
Well, I'm so lonely
I get so lonely I could die

[Verse 3]
Now the bellhop's tears keep flowing
The desk clerk's dressed in black
Well they've been so long on lonely street
They'll never look back

[Chorus]
You make me so lonely baby
Well, I'm so lonely
I get so lonely I could die

[Verse 4]
Well now, if your baby leaves you
And you got a tale to tell
Just take a walk down lonely street
To Heartbreak Hotel


Title: Heart-Shaped Box

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
She eyes me like a Pisces when I am weak
I've been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks
I've been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap
I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black

[Chorus]
Hey! Wait! I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey! Wait! I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey! Wait! I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Your advice

[Verse 2]
Meat-eating orchids forgive no one just yet
Cut yourself on angel's hair and baby's breath
Broken hymen of Your Highness, I'm left black
Throw down your umbilical noose, so I can climb right back

[Verse 1]
She eyes me like a Pisces when I am weak
I've been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks
I've been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap
I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black


Title: Heart-shaped Chevrolet

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
You're bigger than Elvis
You're cooler than B.I.G
You're smashin' the dishes
You're Billy the Kid
You're very American, sugar
Marry me, Dick
I love you

[Verse 2]
We're on the road to the Jersey Shore
One stoppin' at the Staten Island Mall
Pullin' over at the 7/11
And you buy me pie because I'm sweeter than heaven

[Verse 3]
You say you love everything I am
Love my lips and my golden tan
You love my heart-shaped sunglasses
Love my heart-shaped sunglasses
Love my heart-shaped sunglasses
Spin me 'round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
Top down, heaven like you're crazy
You let me drive, I'll let you go all the way
I'll never ever, ever, ever let you get away, away


Title: Heaven

Lyrics:
Give peace a chance
Let the fear you have fall away
I've got my eye on you
I've got my eye on you

She mad I got hoes
I told her that she so much better
They hittin my line but I don't wanna go
Cause all that they want is the cheddar
Tired of me yeah girl I know
3 bitches like tic tac toe
That mean I got 3 in a row
These girls gon take my soul I know that im trippin
She not finna take my ass to heaven what happened to Adam bitch don't trust womеn
I done talked to her so many timеs I told her wassup
She still don't get it
And you stay on the back of my mind I would never cap not talkin a fitted
And I still love you deep down but I gotta get high for me to admit it

Fuck it one more shot
Nigga test me than he gon die
It's a bad day to be my opp
That nigga dissin that shit wasn't fye but I bet that nigga still gon drop

And my gma said she proud of me she said I remind her mom
And the same bitches doubted me are the hoes that wanna come to prom
Too many opps im rollin up
Fuck that im bout to bring out a bong

Niggas got my name in they mouth so much you might well throw me up
And if you hated on me and you doubted me lil nigga you owe me one
That bitch stress me out so much
She finna hate when I get me a gun
Chill on the top of the roof with a blunt
Me and the guys gettin booted and stuff

My bitch a angel
I might just get her a halo
Bad bitch like doja
Finna do what I say so
Shoutout to my main hoe
Shawty pushin out plays though
She used to be my main goal
She said I act like a "A Hole"

Shit I like it better when she on her knees like in a sanctuary
Yo mans crib lookin dead as fuck like that nigga livin in a cemetery
He tried to pull up with a lil weapon but that nigga wasn't scary
And she said Kxzia do too much
And I told her babygirl I am a Aries

Title: Heavy Hitter

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I was loungin' at the Chateau Marmont
Glimmerin' by the swimmin' pool
My man walked in like a slow-motion movie
I said, "You're so cool"

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I heard a man screamin', "Lights, camera, action!"
I c-c-can't remember what happened
I overdose, you throw me over your shoulder
I was dyin', you were screamin'
"Open up that Lamborghini"

[Chorus]
Open up your butterfly doors
(Heavy hitter)
Open up your butterfly doors
(What do you say?)
Open up your butterfly doors
(Heavy hitter)
Let's ch-ch-change our DNA
Let's change our DNA

[Verse 2]
You're the king mafia baby
I'm the Queen of Alchemy
I know a way to make gold
By mixin' our souls to escape reality

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Me and Monterrey went to that ocean
I got that magical trance potion
Gotta leave, I can't wait 'til I'm older
You was laughin', I was runnin'
Use that remote to open up

[Chorus]
Open up your butterfly doors
(Heavy hitter)
Open up your butterfly doors
(What do you say?)
Open up your butterfly doors

Open up your butterfly doors

Title: He Hits Me Because He Loves Me

Lyrics:
He hits me because he loves me
He hits me because he loves me
I'm tired of not being myself
I'm tired of [?]
I'd put his things on the shelf but I can't
'Cause I'm different than all of my lady friends
I gotta live in a different kind of life
My profession isn't the one I would like

[?]
But he hits me because he loves me
And all of the ones he wanted
Oh, and one thing they all know that he's here
He hits me because he loves me
He hits me because there's nobody but me

'Cause he hits me because he loves me
Throws me hard 'cause there's no one but me
And we fight like there's no one watching
But honey, in the eyes of God
And he hurts me because he wants me
And he looks at me like the one
And there's no one forever loving
In the stars [?]


Title: Henry, come on

Lyrics:
Lyrics from Snippet

[Chorus]
I mean, Henry, come on
Do you think I'd really choose it?
All this off and on
Henry, come on
I mean, baby, come on
Do you think I'd really lose it on ya?
If you did nothing wrong
(Henry, come on)

[Verse]
Last call (Hey, y'all)
Hang his hat up on the wall
Tell him that his cowgirl is gone
Come on and giddy-up


Title: Heroin

Lyrics:
I’m coming home soon
From my trip across the dying state
Where I learned of all the souls that came before
I might stay a while more
Settle down maybe have a kid
You should come back

And if you want to come and get it
Baby we could light it up so

Oh
You got me screaming like
Oh
I’m far from home
Broken bones
All alone in this burning world
Shooting the last of heroin

You should stay that close to Jesus
Keep that bottle at your hand my man
Find a way back to my bed again
Sing me like a bible hymn
We should come back to Arkansas
Trade that body for that can of gin
Like a little piece of heaven
No more candle in the wind

I think I’m gonna go soon
For a trip up to Tahoe lake
Where we stayed the night
Just making all our stories
I’m sorry honey
If you just wanted one and done
But baby
I’m not made that way

Oh
You got me screaming like
Oh
I’m far from home
Broken bones
All alone in this burning world
Shooting the last of heroin

You should stay that close to Jesus
Keep that bottle at your hand my man
Find a way back to my bed again
Sing me like a bible hymn
We should come back to Arkansas
Trade that body for that can of gin
Like a little piece of heaven
No more candle in the wind

Oh
You got me screaming like
Oh
I’m far from home
Broken bones
All alone in this burning world
Shooting the last of heroin

You should stay that close to Jesus
Keep that bottle at your hand my man
Find a way back to my bed again
Sing me like a bible hymn
We should come back to Arkansas
Trade that body for that can of gin
Like a little piece of heaven
No more candle in the wind


Title: Hey Blue Baby

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Hey blue baby
Put that Hank Williams on
It's your little blue baby
Callin' for her favorite song
Get out that whiskey
Pour it right quickly
Put them hallway lights on
I hope one day you can remember
Our love before it all went wrong

[Chorus]
But the only stars we saw were in the sky
Not the boulevard
And the only thing we wanted was to be free
And the only girl you had eyes for played downtown
At the local bar
That was me
She was me

[Verse 2]
Hey blue baby
Get that old pickup goin'
Turn it once, twice, three times
If you love me, oh
Get out that dirt bike
Get on that turnpike
Do what you have to do
Just know your baby's back here waiting
Just know she thinks you're really cool

[Chorus - Variation]
And the only stars we saw were in the sky
Not the boulevard
And the only thing we need is to be free
And the only girl you have eyes for plays downtown
At the local bar
That was me
She was me

[Bridge]
I tell you all the time, get yourself in line
Tired of waitin', tired of cryin'
I tell you all the time, get yourself in line
Tired of yellin', tired of hollerin'
You're making me blue, you're making me blue
Making me blue, just do what you do

[Chorus - Variation]
And the only stars we need were in the sky
Not the boulevard
And the only thing we want is to be free
And the only girl that you love still
Plays downtown at the local bar
Yeah she's me
Yeah she's me


Title: Hey You

Lyrics:
[Intro]
Do, do
Ah, ah
I said

[Chorus]
Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I know that it's wrong but no one can save me

[Verse 1]
He’s a walk with the past
Love of the fast
Girls in the fast lane
His knuckles are brass
A heart like a horse
Love of the games, gold in his veins

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Met him at the club
Singing my songs
He says, "Are you famous?"
I was once
A b-movie actress
Has been, but never was
He knows that it's love

[Verse 2]
He saw me on stage
Pointed my way
The look of desire, all on his face
I gave him the eye
And took my place
I could tell that he'd be mine by daytime

[Chorus]
Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I can’t stop myself 'cause I like them crazy
Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I know that it's wrong but no one can save me

[Verse 3]
He's a man with a cast
Cane and a glass
Rim full of champagne, looking for class
A mind like a steel cage
Soul full of rage
Tactical nature so they call him insane

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Met him at the club
And from that night on
He called me his princess, right on!
I'm his little ex-beauty queen
Never going back to where I've been

[Chorus]
Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I can't stop myself 'cause I like them crazy
Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I know that it’s wrong but no one can save me

[Bridge]
No one can save me
Oh, do, do, woah
When did I ever care
What they said about our love, my baby
My baby boo

Yo, our friends think it’s sad
Living so bad
I'm always crying
He’s always mad
Our life is a mess
Oh it's a shame
What did they see in each other?", they say

[Pre-Chorus 2 - Variation]
I met him at the club
And from that night on
Called me his princess, right on!
I'm his little ex-beauty queen
Never going back to where I've been

[Chorus]
Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I can’t stop myself 'cause I like them crazy
Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I know that it's wrong but no one can save me
Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I can't stop myself 'cause I like them crazy
Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I know that it's wrong but no one can save me

[Outro]
No one can save me
No one can save me

Title: Hollywood

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
One day, my hoops will be made of diamonds
My knuckles made of real gold
I'll spend my days getting high with all my friends
In the glamorous and green old part of Hollywood

[Pre-Chorus]
Sun will rise, I'm a supernova
Body electric and I dance like Morrison
When the night begins, baby comes alive again

[Chorus]
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
I'm alive again
I'm alive again

[Verse 2]
One day, I'll drive in a gold Mercedes Benz
Singing opera on Bel Air Road
Hair to my ass will be flying in the wind
Shootin' heroin and speedballs

[Pre-Chorus]
See the sea, I'm a supernova
I walk on water and I dance like Joplin
When the sun descends, I dive into the waves again

[Chorus]
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
I'm alive again
I'm alive again

[Bridge]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, c-can you see me?

Ah-ah, ah-ah, my heart shakin' fast
I can feel that you're the one for me
You'll be my first, and you'll be my last

Title: Hollywood Bowl

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I know I'm not Joni Mitchell
But I've got a dad who plays like Billy Joel
I know I can't see the whole picture
But I like to dream about my days of gold

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got a swimming pool, I like to float on the surface
And think about all of my memories of old
Oh, those days of old

[Chorus]
Twice I sang at the Hollywood Bowl
And my dad plays just like Billy Joel
And I'm young when I'm old and I'm old when I'm young when I'm old
At the whims of my heart and my soul

[Verse 2]
I don't think of myself as special
But I like to live my life colorful and bold

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got a swimming pool, I like to float on the surface
And think of the stories I've already sold
Oh
I've got a feeling, I've got a memory
Why wait for Heavеn when I can have Heavеn right here like I'm told?
Oh, just like I'm told

[Chorus]
Twice I sang at the Hollywood Bowl
And my dad plays just like Billy Joel
And I'm young when I'm old and I'm old when I'm young when I'm old
And I'll follow wherever you go

[Outro]
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da
I've got a swimming pool
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da
I like to float away
Ooh
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah


Title: Hollywood’s Dead

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Our kind of love
It was once in a lifetime
It couldn't last
It was doomed from the first time
And you
Were '50s cool
In blue suede shoes
But it was a cover for all of the trouble
You got into

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I always fall for the wrong guy
Things that are bad always taste nice
That's what girls like me do, lose you

[Chorus]
Don't tell me it's over
Don't tell me it's over
Hollywood's dead
Elvis is cryin'
Vicious in flames
Roland is dyin'
And in the light, you're sickeningly beautiful
Say goodbye, you're sickeningly beautiful

[Verse 2]
This kind of life
Wasn't meant for the good girl
Try as I might
In the end, it's a cruel world
And you
Are livin' proof
Sinatra aloof
But you were an actor who only went after
The ones who swooned

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I always fall for the same type
Gangsters in Vegas on game night
That's what girls like me like, the limelight

[Chorus]
Don't tell me it's over
Don't tell me it's over
Hollywood's dead
Elvis is cryin'
Marilyn's sad
Hendrix is lying there
In the light, you're sickeningly beautiful
Say goodbye, you're sickeningly beautiful

[Bridge]
If you should go before me, then know
That I always loved you
There's no one above you, babe

[Chorus - Variation]
Don't tell me it's over
Don't tell me it's over
Hollywood's dead
Elvis is cryin'
Lennon, wake up
Cobain, stop lying there
In the light, you're sickeningly beautiful
Say goodbye, you're sickeningly beautiful
Say goodnight, you're so beautiful

[Outro]
Hollywood's dead
Hollywood's dead
Hollywood's dead, yeah
Hollywood's dead
Hollywood's dead
Hollywood's dead, yeah

Title: Honeymoon

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
We both know
That it's not fashionable to love me
But you don't go
'Cause, truly, there's nobody for you but me
We could cruise to the blues
Wilshire Boulevard, if we choose
Or whatever you wanna do
We make the rules

[Chorus]
Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon
Say you want me, too
Say you want me, too
Dark blue
Dark blue

[Verse 2]
We both know
The history of violence that surrounds you
But I'm not scared
There's nothing to lose now that I've found you
And we could cruise to the news
Pico Boulevard in your used
Little bullet car, if we choose
Mr. Born-to-Lose

[Chorus]
Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon
Say you want me, too
Say you want me, too
Dark blue
Dark blue

[Bridge]
There are violets in your eyes
There are guns that blaze around you
There are roses in between my thighs
Fire that surrounds you
It's no wonder every man in town
Had neither fought nor found you
Everything you do is elusive, too
Even your honey dew

[Chorus]
Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do, da-da-da
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do, da-da-da
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do, da-da-da-da-da

[Outro]
Dreaming away your life
Dreaming away your life
Dreaming away your life, mmm
Dreaming away your life
Dreaming away your life
Dreaming away your life, mmm


Title: ​hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have - but i have it

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I was reading Slim Aarons and I got to thinking that I thought
Maybe I'd get less stressed if I was tested less like
All of these debutantes
Smiling for miles in pink dresses and high heels on white yachts
But I'm not, baby, I'm not
No, I'm not, that, I'm not

[Chorus]
I've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown
24/7 Sylvia Plath
Writing in blood on my walls
'Cause the ink in my pen don't work in my notepad
Don't ask if I'm happy, you know that I'm not
But at best, I can say I'm not sad
'Cause hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have

[Verse 2]
I had 15-year dances
Church basement romances, yeah, I've cried
Spilling my guts with the Bowery Bums
Is the only love I've ever known
Except for the stage, which I also call home, when I'm not
Servin' up God in a burnt coffee pot for the triad
Hello, it's the most famous woman you know on the iPad
Calling from beyond the grave, I just wanna say, "Hi, Dad"

[Chorus]
I've been tearing up town in my fucking white gown
Like a goddamn near sociopath
Shaking my ass is the only thing that's
Got this black narcissist off my back
She couldn't care less, and I never cared more
So there's no more to say about that
Except hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman with my past

[Bridge]
There's a new revolution, a loud evolution that I saw
Born of confusion and quiet collusion of which mostly I've known
A modern day woman with a weak constitution, 'cause I've got
Monsters still under my bed that I could never fight off
A gatekeeper carelessly dropping the keys on my nights off

[Chorus]
I've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown
24/7 Sylvia Plath
Writing in blood on your walls
'Cause the ink in my pen don't look good in my pad
They write that I'm happy, they know that I'm not
But at best, you can see I'm not sad
But hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have

[Outro]
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
But I have it
Yeah, I have it
Yeah, I have it
I have


Title: Hotel Sayre

Lyrics:
[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
Will you still love me
When I'm no longer
Young and beautiful?
I know you will
I know you will
I know that you will...
Will you still love me
When I got nothing but my aching soul?


Title: Hot Hot Hot

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
You are rollin' hard
Santa Monica Boulevard
Black tint glass on your cherry red car
You know very well no one's bad as you are

[Chorus]
You're hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
You know that I want what you got
You're hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
You know that I want what you got

Your switchblade smile and your battle wound scars
I'm so hot for you, baby, baby

[Verse 3]
Oh, you look like art
Shinin' like a star in the dark
Lightnin' strikes, you're my infinite spark
Set the world on fire and it's lovely to watch

[Pre-Chorus 2]
They're scared of your name
They know you're insane
I like it that way
I have to be your girl
I gotta be your girl

[Chorus - Variation]
You're hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
You know that I want what you got
You shot, shot, shot, shot, shot
An arrow through my heart now I want you a lot

[Bridge]
Life is like, like a little game
That we like to play
Just for fun, just for fun
'Cause we take nothin' seriously
Nothin's wrong, nothin's wrong, oh
Life is like, like a piece of cake
'Cause we love to play
Just for fun, in the sun
Yeah we know nothin' means a thing cause
We have won, boy we won, won, won, won, won, won, won

[Verse 4]
Oh be still my heart
You're shining like a light in the dark

[Chorus]
You're hot, hot, hot, hot, hot

You know that I want what you got
You're hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
You know that I want what you got
You're hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
You know that I want what you got


Title: How Do You Know Me So Well?

Lyrics:
What an unusual name, you said
What a spectacular redhead
You really seem like a prize to me
And you are so mysterious
When you are not delirious
Oh what you mean to me

And she said, how do you know me so well
After only one night?
How do I love you, tell me
With all of my might

I'm indebted to you
I'm indebted to you
Always

There's something she doesn't know about
A secret he doesn't show about
A sensitive side all his own, oh my
She got her skeletons as well
Some secrets he know she'd never tell
People who keep her alone

And she said
"How did I know you so well, why am I not surprised?"
He said, "Baby, go to hell."
And that was the demise of their love

Don't ever pick up a man if you don't think he'll understand
Don't ever trust yourself if you have a history of being a loving fool

So that's what she got when she married him
A lifetime promise to carry him
Him and his every second of need
I do not know you so well
Not more than that one night
Do you still love me, oh tell me
With all of your might?

I'm indebted to you
I'm indebted to you, my love


Title: How to disappear

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
John met me down on the boulevard
Cry on his shoulder 'cause life is hard
The waves came in over my head
What you been up to, my baby?
Haven't seen you 'round here lately
All of the guys tell me lies, but you don't
You just crack another beer
And pretend that you're still here

[Chorus]
This is how to disappear
This is how to disappear

[Verse 2]
Joe met me down at the training yard
Cuts on his face 'cause he fought too hard
I know he's in over his head
But I love that man like nobody can
He moves mountains and pounds them to ground again
I watched the guys getting high as they fight
For the things that they hold dear
To forget the things they fear

[Chorus]
This is how to disappear
This is how to disappear

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Now it's been years since I left New York
I've got a kid and two cats in the yard
The California sun and the movie stars
I watch the skies getting light as I write
As I think about those years
As I whisper in your ear

[Outro]
I'm always going to be right here
No one's going anywhere


Title: How To Disappear

Lyrics:
John met me down on the boulevard
I cried on his shoulder 'cause life is hard
The waves came in over my head
What you been up to, my baby?
I haven't seen you 'round here lately
All of the guys tell me lies but you don't
You just crack another beer
And pretend that you're still here

This is how to disappear
This is how to disappear

Jim met me down at the training yard
Got cuts on his face 'cause he fought too hard
I know he's in over his head
But I love that man like nobody can
He moves mountains and turns them to ground again
I watched the guys getting high as they fight
For the things that they hold dear
To forget the things they fear

This is how to disappear
This is how to disappear

Now it's been years since I left my town
I've got a kid and two cats in the yard
The California sun and the movie stars
I watch the skies getting light as I write
As I think about those years
And I whisper in your ear

No one's going anywhere
I'm always going to be right here

(Twenty of 'em wrapped up tight and sealed)
(Hundred dollar bill, hundred dollar bill, hundred dollar bill)
(Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill)

[Verse 1]
Jimmy pulls up in his blue Chevy Nova
I have been dyin' for him to come over

I am the New Jersey Dance Queen
He is the gangster action king
He knows that I be selling the body

He understands the sale of self

I am the trailer park darling, he is the one-time come-back king
He knows that I be lookin' to die
He says, baby, pay respect to the high

[Pre-Chorus]
He knows it's a big bad world, knows that I'm a good girl
He understands the sale of self
'Cause cash comes quick when looks can kill

[Chorus]
Hundred dollar bill, hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill

Title: I Can Fly

Lyrics:
[Chorus]
I can fly
You had me caged up like a bird in midsummer
You saw me waiting, I was crazy, on fire, waiting to fly
I can fly

[Verse 1]
I had bright wishes in the summer, I was bathing in sunlight
Painting in the garden like a ghost in mid-July
Running fast from something with my eyes wide like
Saucers spinning in the sun

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream that I was fine
I wasn't crazy, I was divine

[Chorus]
I can fly
You had me caged up like a bird in midsummer
You saw me waiting, I was crazy, on fire, waiting to fly
I can fly

[Verse 2]
Your lies were hot kisses in the summer
I was dreaming of a lake
Dreaming of the water where I'd rise like a phoenix
Or an iron from the fire
I've got things to tell you like I know that you're a liar

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream that I was fine
I wasn't crazy, I was divine

[Chorus]
I can fly
You had me caged up like a bird in midsummer
You saw me waiting, I was crazy, on fire, waiting to fly
I can fly

[Bridge]
Your words cut like a knife in butter
I was fighting for my art
Fighting with my lover, you had me so tied up
Thinking there's no other
Yeah, right
Yeah, right

[Chorus]
I can fly
You had me caged up like a bird in midsummer
You saw me waiting, I was crazy, on fire, waiting to fly
I can fly


Title: Ice Cream

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I wanna be the object of your affection
Give me all your time, touch, money and attention
Pick me up after school
You can be my baby
Maybe we could go somewhere?
Get a little crazy
He's rich and I'm
Wishing I'm
He could be my mister yum
Delicious to the maximum
Chew him up like bubble gum
 
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'm his pretty party favor
He says I'm his favourite flavor
 
[Chorus]
French vanilla ice cream
Making you scream
Ah!
French vanilla ice cream
Making you scream
Ah! Ah!
 
[Post-Chorus]
Ice cream?
You scream yes!
Ice cream?
You scream yes!
 
[Verse 2]
You say that I'm flawless
True perfection
So give me all your drugs, pops, money and connections
Pick me up after school
Acting kinda shady
You the coolest kid in town, I'm your little lady
He's sucking on
Kissing on
Magical musician hun
Drive in at the cinema
Love it when I'm licking him
 
[Pre-Chorus 2]
He's my lovely life saviour
Doesn't mind my bad behaviour
 
[Chorus]
French vanilla ice cream
Making you scream
Ah!
French vanilla ice cream
Making you scream
Ah! Ah!
 
[Post-Chorus]

Sending dirty textext
Yo he never lets me rest
He likes to take me downtown
Cipriani and Lafayette
And he makes me
Makes me hot
Makes me say yes!
 
[Chorus]
Ice cream, ice cream
Ice cream, ice cream
French vanilla ice cream
Making you scream
Ah!
French vanilla ice cream
Making you scream
Ah! Ah!

You scream yes!
Ice cream?
You scream yes!
Ice cream?
You scream yes!
Ice cream?
You scream yes!


Title: I Don’t Wanna Go

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
He don't like no small things
Even ridin' 'round on tall dreams
I don't wanna go
He's a sweet baby, but he looks mean
In his soft leather and his blue jeans

[Pre-Chorus]
He got a way, oh, baby, he got a way, oh, baby
He got a way with his words
They be like diamonds and pearls
They be like diamonds and pearls
He gives to his little favorite girls

[Chorus]
I don't wanna go, go home
I don't wanna go, go home
Baby, tonight
Baby, tonight

[Verse 2]
He don't like no spotlight
Stands real quiet in the moonlight

[Pre-Chorus]
He got a way, oh, baby, he got a way, mm, baby
He got a way with those words
They be like diamonds and pearls
They be like diamonds and pearls
He gives to his little favorite girls

[Chorus]
I don't wanna go, go home
I don't wanna go, go home
Baby, tonight
Baby, tonight

[Bridge]
Lovin' you isn't right
Black leather moonlight (I give in)
Lovin' you isn't right
It's original sin

[Chorus]
I don't wanna go, go home
I don't wanna go, go home
Baby, tonight
Baby, tonight

[Outro]
I feel like I can do anything
Like I can do anything
Like I can do anything that I like
I feel like I can do anything
Like I can do anything
Like I can do anything
Tonight
Baby, tonight
Tonight


Title: If I Die Young

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
All the roses are red, and Jupiter too
I'm lying in my nightgown making confessions to you
It's all over now, baby blue
All my secrets are out, I told them all to you

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's a little grim, but I sing a hymn, only for you
I seal it with a kiss and it goes like this, baby love me too

[Chorus]
If I die young let me die in California
And when I'm gone, let 'em play my favorite song
It's Jimmy Buffett to remember, life's a beach, baby enjoy it

[Post-Chorus]
When I'm done, let the music play on
And on, and on, and on (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Go on, and on, and on

[Verse 2]
All my stories are out, all the lies are out too
When we drive in the nighttime I lift them up to you

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's a little grim, but I sing a hymn, only for you
I seal it with a kiss and it goes like this, baby love me too

[Chorus]
If I die young let me die in California
And when I'm gone, make 'em play my favorite song
It's Jimmy Buffett to remember, life's a beach, baby enjoy it

[Post-Chorus]
When I'm done, let the music play on
And on, and on, and on (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Go on, and on, and on

[Bridge]
Be my baby (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Be my baby tonight
We'll go on, and on, and on
Be my baby (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Be my baby tonight
Go on, and on, and on

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a little grim, but I sing a hymn, only for you
I seal it with a kiss and it goes like this

[Outro]
We'll go on, and on, and on
Be my baby (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Be my baby tonight
Go on, and on, and on


Title: If You Lie Down With Me

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Put your red boots on, baby, giddy up
Baby wants to dance, baby gets her way
Treat me nice, talk to me with that whiskey breath
Twirl me twice, I'll treat you like a holiday

[Pre-Chorus]
And don't say you're over me
When we both know that you ain't
Don't say you're over me
Babe, it's already too late
Just do what you do best with me

[Chorus]
Dance me all around the room
Spin me like a ballerina, super high
Dance me all around the moon
Light me up like the Fourth of July
Once, twice, three times the guy I
Ever thought I would meet, so
Don't say you're over me
When we both know that you lie

[Post-Chorus]
If you lie down, lie next to me
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
If you lie down, lie next to me
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
When you lie down, lie next to me

[Verse 2]
Get your jacket on, be a gentleman
Get into your truck and pick me up at eight
'Cause we were built for the long-haul freight train
Burnt by fire without trial like a stowaway

[Pre-Chorus]
And don't say you're over me
When they all know that you ain't
If you lay down, lie next to me

[Chorus]
Dance me all around the room
Spin me like a ballerina, super high
Dance me all around the moon
Like, six times 'til I'm sick and I cry
Once, twice, three times the guy I
Ever thought I would meet, so
Don't say you're over me
When they all know that you're lying

[Post-Chorus]
If you lie down, lie next to me
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
You lie, you lie
If you lie down, lie next to me
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
You lie, you lie
When you lie down, lie next to me

Title: I Learned How to Make Love from the Movies

Lyrics:
[Chorus]
I learned how to make love from the movies
Catch me waitressin' up Ruby Tuesday’s
Says he wants to buy me and a white milkshake
I’ll serve you up a special side of heartbreak

[Verse 1]
Betty Lou’s working down at the Friendly’s
Met a millionaire while she was serving him pancakes
She served your baby a coke and went outside for a smoke
Before you kiss the alligator don’t ask to see him later

[Chorus]
I learned how to make love from the movies
Catch me waitressin' up Ruby Tuesday’s
Says he wants to buy me and a white milkshake
I’ll serve you up a special side of heartbreak

[Verse 2]
She said Lana Ray you gotta do what I say
My man’s sending his buddy Ray over your way
He knows you’re bad to the bone and that you never come home
But he saw you in a picture and he really wants to meet ya
So if you see him just do what I say
I said okay

[Chorus]
I learned how to make love from the movies
Catch me waitressin up Ruby Tuesday’s
Says he wants to buy me and a white milkshake
I’ll serve you up a special side of heartbreak

[Outro]
He’s my rodeo king and I’m his Alabama
Diamond horseshoe ring and I know how my man likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it


Title: I’ll Be Home for Christmas (From The Kacey Musgraves Christmas Show)

I'll be home for Christmas
You can plan on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents under the tree

[Chorus: Kacey Musgraves, Lana Del Rey, Both]
Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

[Bridge: Kacey Musgraves]
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents under the tree

[Chorus: Kacey Musgraves, Both]
Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
If only in my dreams
Mmm

[Outro: Kacey Musgraves, Lana Del Rey]

Title: I Look In People’s Windows / Snow On The Beach

Lyrics:
[Part I: I Look in People's Windows]

[Verse 1]
I had died the tiniest death
I spied the catch in your breath
Out, out, out, out, out, out
Northbound I got carried away
As you boarded your train
South, south, south, south, south, south

[Pre-Chorus]
A feather taken by the wind blowing
I'm afflicted by the not knowing, so

[Chorus]
I look in people's windows
Transfixed by rose golden glows
They have their friends over to drink nice wine
I look in people's windows
To see you're at their table
What if your eyes looked up and met mine
One more time?
Time

[Verse 2]
You had stopped and tilted your head
I still ponder what it meant
Now, now, now, now, now, now
I tried searching faces on streets
What are the chances you'd be
Downtown, downtown, downtown

[Pre-Chorus]
Does it feel alright to not know me?
I'm addicted to the "if only"

[Chorus]
So I look in people's windows
Like I'm some deranged weirdo
I attend Christmas parties from outside
I look in people's windows
In case you're at their table
What if your eyes looked up and met mine
One more time?
One more time

[Part II: Snow On The Beach]

[Verse 1]
One night, a few moons ago
I saw flecks of what could've been lights
But it might just have been you
Passing by unbeknownst to me
Life is emotionally abusive
And time can't stop me quite like you did
And my flight was awful, thanks for asking
I'm unglued, thanks to you

[Chorus]
And it's like snow at the beach
Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me
Tonight feels impossible
But it's comin' down
No sound, it's all around

[Post-Chorus]
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
"It's just me guys, sorry"
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow, ah

[Part III: I Look in People's Windows]

[Chorus]
I look in people's windows
Like I'm some deranged weirdo
I attend Christmas parties from outside
I look in people's windows
In case you're at their table
What if your eyes looked up and met mine
One more time?


Title: I Love Paris

Lyrics:
[Chorus]
I love Paris in the spring time
I love Paris in the fall
I love Paris in the summer when it sizzles
I love Paris in the winter when it drizzles


Title: I Love You

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I like to see everything in neon
Drink lime green, stay up 'til dawn
Maybe the way that I'm living is killing me
I like to light up the stage with a song
Do shit to keep me turned on
But one day I woke up like
"Maybe I'll do it differently"

[Pre-Chorus]
So I moved to California, but it's just a state of mind
It turns out everywhere you go, you take yourself, that's not a lie
Wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
It's killing me slowly

[Chorus]
Dream a little dream of me
Make me into something sweet
Turn the radio on, dancing to a pop song
I love you
I love you
I love you
I really do

[Verse 2]
I used to shoot up my veins in neon
And shit's even brighter; you're gone
So many things I would say to you
I want you

[Pre-Chorus]
You moved to California, but it's just a state of mind
And you know everyone adores you
You can't feel it and you're tired
Baby, wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
But it's killing me slowly

[Chorus]
Dream a little dream of me
Turn this into something sweet
Turn the radio on, dancing to a pop song
I love you
I love you
I love you
I really do

[Bridge]
It turns out California's more than just a state of mind
I met you on the boulevard, wind through my hair, you blew my mind
And if I wasn't so fucked up, I think I'd fuck you all the time
(I really do)
It's killing me slowly

[Chorus]
I love you (I moved to California, but it's just a state of mind)
I love you (It turns out everywhere you go, you take yourself, that's not a lie)
I love you (Wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine)
I really do (It's killing me slowly)

[Outro]
(I love you)
California dreamin', got my money on my mind
(I love you)
Chances in my veins, running out of time
(I love you)
California dreamin', got my money on my mind
(I really do)
Chances in my veins, running out of time
(I love you)
California dreamin', got my money on my mind
(I love you)
Chances in my veins, running out of time
(I love you)
California dreamin', got my money on my mind
(I really do)
Chances in my veins, running out of time


Title: I’m indebted to you

Lyrics:
What an unusual name, you said
What a spectacular redhead
You really seem like a prize to me
And you are so mysterious
When you are not delirious
Oh what you mean to me
And she said, how do you know me so well
After only one night?
How do I love you, tell me
With all of my might i'm indebted to you
I'm indebted to you always
There's something she doesn't know about
A secret he doesn't show about
A sensitive side all his own, oh my
She got her skelеtons as well
Some secrеts he know she'd never tell
People who keep her alone
And she said "How did I know you so well
Why am I not surprised?"
He said, "Baby, go to hell"
And that was the demise of their love
Don't ever pick up a man if
You don't think he'll understand
Don't ever trust yourself if you have a
History of being a loving fool
So that's what she got when she married him
A lifetime promise to carry him
Him and his every second of need
I do not know you so well
Not more than that one night
Do you still love me, oh tell me
With all of your might? I'm indebted to you
I'm indebted to you, my love


Title: I’m just trying to be free, from the average person’s life (Unreleased)

Lyrics:
Sipping on a cherry cola
In a velvet dress and pearls
Watching the world go by
Feeling like a movie girl

I'm a Hollywood sadcore
Living in a dream
But it's not what it seems
Cause darling, I'm just trying to be free

Walking down the Sunset Strip
In my platform heels and shades
People stare but I don't care
Cause I'm living in my own world, in my own ways

I'm a Hollywood sadcore
Living in a dream
But it's not what it seems
Cause darling, I'm just trying to be free

I'm not afraid to be different
I'll sing my songs and paint my lips
I'll be who I wanna be
Cause darling, I'm just trying to be free

I'm a Hollywood sadcore
Living in a dream
But it's not what it seems
Cause darling, I'm just trying to be free

In this town full of stars
I'll shine the brightest one
Cause darling, I'm just trying to be free


Title: ​i’m over again

Lyrics:
[NESSA]
Slow and steady wins the race
One by one they all break
Look out the window
See there face
All full of terror
Win this race
[LANA]
Can't stop the feeling
Aderineline
Right through my veins
Hurts to cancel it out of my brain

[LANA]
I’m falling down
Quickly
Two laps done
I'm ready
I'm falling down
Ready to win
Can’t stop now
I'm over agian
Mhm
I'm over again
Mhm
I'm over again

[NESSA]
Wind In my hair
Shades on my face
Feet on the petal
Not a care in this race

[NESSA
Can't stop the feeling
Aderineline
Right through my veins
Hurts to cancel it out of my brain

[LANA]
I'm falling down
Quickly
Two laps done
I'm ready
I'm falling down
Ready to win
Can’t stop now
I’m over agian
Mhm
I'm over again
Mhm

[NESSA]
Feet on the track
Relief I'vе never had
Is gone away
I've done it again
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

[LANA]
I'm falling down
Quickly
All laps done
I’m ready
I'm falling down
Ready to win
Can't stop now
I'm over agian
Mhm
I'm over again
Mhm
I'm over again


Title: I Must Be Stupid for Being So Happy

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Well I must be stupid for feeling so happy
I must be crazy for calling you mine
My life's like a movie but I just let it move me
So slow like a two-step, you hold me real tight

[Chorus]
All my friends say my life’s
Like a bad country song
I just smile, say "I know, but I like to sing along"
For the sweet wedding days
I just put Hank Williams on
I must be stupid for feeling so happy
But they can call me what they want

[Verse 2]
They think I'm crazy but I keep laughing
They think I'm funny for wearing a smile
But it’s just in my nature and it's just how you move me
Real slow like a movie and I wanna rewind

[Chorus]
All my friends say my life's
Like a bad country song
I just smile, say "I know, but I like to sing along"
For the sweet wedding days
I just put Hank Williams on
I must be stupid for feeling so happy
But they can call me what they want

[Outro]
Ah, la, la
Ah, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
I must be stupid for feeling so happy
But they can call me what they want


Title: I’m Writing My Future

Lyrics:
[Snippet]
May my eyes always stay level to the horizon
May they never gaze as high as heaven to ask why
May I never go wear angels fear to tread
So as to have to ask for answers in the sky


Title: In My Feelings

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I'm smokin' while I'm runnin'
On my treadmill, but I'm comin' up roses
Could it be that I fell for another loser?
I'm cryin' while I'm cummin'
Makin' love while I'm makin' good money
Sobbin' in my cup of coffee 'cause I fell for another loser

[Pre-Chorus]
Get that cigarette smoke out of my face
You've been wastin' my time while you're takin' what's mine
With the things that you're doin'
Talk that talk, well, now they all know your name
And there's no comin' back from the place that you came
Baby, don't do it

[Chorus]
'Cause you got me in my feelings (Got me feeling so much right now)
Talkin' in my sleep again (I'm makin' no sense at all)
Talkin' while I'm screamin' (Got me feelin' so crazy right now)
Who's doper than this bitch? Who's freer than me?
You wanna make the switch? Be my guest, baby
I'm feelin' all my fuckin' feelings

[Verse 2]
I'm smokin' while I'm runnin'
This town and you better believe it, honey
I'm laughin' as I'm taking no prisoners and taking down names
I'm cryin' while I'm gunnin'
In the smoke, they can hear me comin'
If you were me and I was you, I'd get out of my way

[Pre-Chorus]
Get that cigarette smoke out of my face
You've been wastin' my time while you're takin' what's mine
Well, you know what you're doin'
Talk that talk, well, now they all know your name
And there's no comin' back from the place that you came
Baby, don't do it

[Chorus]
'Cause you got me in my feelings (Got me feeling so much right now)
Talkin' in my sleep again (I'm makin' no sense at all)
Talkin' while I'm screamin' (Got me feelin' so crazy right now)
Who's doper than this bitch? Who's freer than me?
You wanna make the switch? Be my guest, baby
I'm feelin' all my fuckin' feelings

[Bridge]
Got me up in this place right now
Makin' no sense at all
Got me up in this place right now
Against the wall
Got me feelin' so blue
Makin' no sense at all
Gotta leave right now

[Chorus]
'Cause you got me in my feelings (Got me feeling so much right now)
Talkin' in my sleep again (I'm makin' no sense at all)
Talkin' while I'm screamin' (Got me feelin' so crazy right now)
Who's doper than this bitch? Who's freer than me?
You wanna make the switch? Be my guest, baby
I'm feelin' all my fuckin' feelings

Title: In the Sun

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Everybody said that it wasn’t love
I was dumb
I was getting high on your sugar rush
For too long
You told me that we could have it all
Now you’re postin' pictures on your wall
Of you and her together, what the hell?
We were in heaven then we fell
I believed you, said I’d never leave you
I-

[Chorus]
I thought that you loved me, I was wrong
You took all my money and you went off on the run
Livin' with my best friend in the sun, in the sun
You told me that we could have it all
Now you’re postin' pictures on your wall
Of you and her together, havin' fun, havin' fun

[Verse 2]
Everybody said: “Careful of that guy”
Baby couldn’t stop, it was suicide
Headed for a cliff, eyes open wide
You were feignin' love by holdin' tight
But I need you, don’t want to, but need to
I-

[Chorus]
I thought that you loved me, I was wrong
You took all my money and you went off on the run
Livin' with my best friend in the sun, in the sun
You told me that we could have it all
Now you’re postin' pictures on your wall
Of you and her together, havin' fun, havin' fun

[Bridge]
You been messin' around with my beating heart
You should be ashamed
Boy, you never loved me from the start
Such a wicked game
I told you I needed somebody
I never used you for love or for money, boy
I feel like I can’t trust nobody
Beat on my heart and you left it all bloody, now

[Chorus]
I thought that you loved me, I was wrong
You took all my money and you went off on the run
Livin' with my best friend in the sun, in the sun
You told me that we could have it all
Now you’re postin' pictures on your wall
Of you and her together, havin' fun, havin' fun

Title: In Wendy

Lyrics:
Well, dark clouds they'll subside for awhile
And sit down, I can make my friends smile
I have lost a lot but I'm sane, you know
And I'm calling you up just to say hello, so
Hi, my lovely, hi, my lovely
I am someone else

I did think I would live life alone
I was sure I was made out of stone
I have lost a lot but you helped me find
What was really real and some peace of mind
And I'm awfully thankful and I am so grateful
I need no one else

Will you think of me when I am gone?
Will you comfort me when I am wrong?
I have a lost a lot but I'm feeling fine cause I
Finally found out nothing's mine and I'm
Only human, I'm so human
I am nothing else


Title: Is It Wrong

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I guess it’s symptomatic of a slight infatuation
Stalkin' you has sorta become like my occupation
Used to be a beauty queen with simple acquisitions
Met my local rock star now I’m havin' visions

[Pre-Chorus]
I fell for you, you like me too
Let’s get it on, check one, two
I fell for you, you want me too
Let’s get it on

[Chorus]
Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
I’m makin' out with you while you’re singin' your song
Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
You’re playing your guitar and it’s turnin' me on
You got your eyeliner, long hair, walkin’ around like you don’t care
You got me in the back of your car like a star
Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
If it’s wrong, I don’t wanna be right

[Verse 2]
I get so systematic in this kind of situation
I need it, have to have it, t-take over, domination
Used to be so simple, never wantin’, never wishin’
Now I’m hooked on fame and I’m a girl on a mission

[Pre-Chorus - Variation]
I fall for you, it’s all for you
Let’s get it on, check one, two
I fall for you, it’s all for you
Let’s get it on

[Chorus]
Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
I’m makin' out with you while you’re singin' your song
Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
You’re playing your guitar and it’s turnin' me on
You got your eyeliner, long hair, walkin’ around like you don’t care
You got me in the back of your car like a star
Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
If it’s wrong, I don’t wanna be right

[Bridge]
A funny little thing about love is that you’re blind all the time
And even when you think you had enough
You’re wanting more, it isn’t right but
You can’t stop

[Chorus - Variation]
You got your eyeliner, long hair, walkin’ around like you don’t care
You got me in the back of your ca-ca-ca-car-r-r
You got your eyeliner, long hair, walkin’ around like you don’t care
You got me in the back of your ca-ca-ca-car-r-r
Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
If it’s wrong I don’t wanna be right


Title: Is This Happiness

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
High up in the Hollywood hills, taking violet pills
Writing all of my songs about my cheap thrills
You're a hard man to love and I'm
A hard woman to keep track of

[Pre-Chorus]
You like to rage, don't do that
You want your way, you make me so mad
Got your gun, I've got my dad
Hm-hm-hm-hm-hm-hm-hm

[Chorus]
Is this happiness?
Is this happiness?
Is this happiness?
Is this happiness?

[Verse 2]
High up in the Hollywood hills, crushing violet pills
You've been trying to write a novel about your cheap thrills
You think you're Hunter S. Thompson
I think you're fucking crazy as the day's long

[Pre-Chorus]
Man to man, heart to heart
I love you but you drive me so far
Wish you well on that star
Hm-hm-hm-hm-hm-hm-hm

[Chorus]
Is this happiness?
Is this happiness?
Is this happiness?
Is this happiness?

[Bridge]
Witch Hazel, Witch Hazel
Betrayal, betrayal
One gun on the table
Headshot if you're able

[Chorus]
Is this happiness?
Is this happiness?
Is this happiness?
Is this happiness?

[Outro]
Hm-hm-hm-hm
Hm-hm-hm-hm
Hm-hm-hm-hm
Hm-hm-hm-hm


Title: I Talk to Jesus

Lyrics:
[Intro]
One, two
One, two

[Verse 1]
I go back to Alabama
Take a look at my life
What the fuck happened here?
I guess what they meant when
They paid the price
I go back to Alabama
Take a look at my life
Where are the trailer parks?
And where all the Christmas lights?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I had a boyfriend
He came from this town
We used to pretend we were married and start again
He read the Bible
Showed me what Jesus said
He said I should rewrite (He only read the red)

[Chorus]
I want Jesus to take me out this life, baby
And I talk to Jesus
And ask him if he'll think of saving me

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
I go back to Alabama
Take a look at my life
Nothing looks familiar here
No one even that I like
I go back to Alabama
Take a look at my life
I was so much happier when I was gonna be your wife

[Pre-Chorus 2]
We had a deal and
I fucked it up when
I made the decision to become someone
We had the one thing that no one ever had
True love
It's true love

[Chorus]
I ask Jesus to take me out this life baby
And I talk to Jesus
And ask him if he'll think of saving me

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Bridge]
I never meant to hurt you baby
It's so hard to be true
In this world where everything's so black and blue
I never meant to hurt you darling
It's so hard to be good
In this world where you do what you know you shouldn’t

[Chorus]
I want Jesus to take me out this life baby
And I talk to Jesus
And ask him if he'll think of saving me

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Title: It Was a Very Good Year

Lyrics:
Note: The following are the lyrics of the original song
Lana's version might differ (if it ever resurfaces)

[Verse 1]
When I was seventeen
It was a very good year
It was a very good year for small town girls
And soft summer nights
We'd hide from the lights
On the village green
When I was seventeen

[Verse 2]
When I was twenty-one
It was a very good year
It was a very good year for city girls
Who lived up the stair
With all that perfumed hair
And it came undone
When I was twenty-onе

[Verse 3]
When I was thirty-five
It was a very good yеar
It was a very good year for blue-blooded girls
Of independent means
We'd ride in limousines
Their chauffeurs would drive
When I was thirty-five

[Verse 4]
But now the days are short
I'm in the autumn of the year
And now I think of my life as vintage wine
From fine old kegs
From the brim to the dregs
It poured sweet and clear
It was a very good year


Title: I Want It All

Lyrics:
[intro]
Money is the anthem of succes
So before we go out, what's your address?


[pre-Chrorus]
I'm the national anthem
God, you're so handsome
Take me to the Hamptons, Bugatti Veyron
He loves to romance 'em
Reckless abandon
Holding me for ransom, upper echelon
He says to be cool, but I don't know how yet
Wind in my hair
Hand on the back of my neck
I said, "Can we party later on", he said "Yes, yes, yes..."
(Of course we can, my darling)

[Chorus]
And I want it all
I want the rings and bling and the sweet skyline
Yeah, I want it all (from you)
I wanna sing, wanna swing on the stage and shine
Yeah, I want it all
I want my dreams, want the things that love can't buy
Yeah, I want it all (from you)
Bye, bye, baby
Bye, bye, bye

[whisper]
Money is the reason we exist
Everybody knows it, it's a fact kiss, kiss

[verse 1]
I sing the national anthem
While I'm standing over your body, hold you like a python
And you can't keep your hands off me or your pants on
See what you've done to me, King of Chevron
He says to be cool, but I'm already coolest
I said to get real
Don't you know who you're dealing with?
Um, do you think you'll buy me lots of diamonds?
(Yes, of course I will my darling)

[Chorus]
And I want it all
I want the rings and bling and the sweet skyline
Yeah, I want it all (from you)
I wanna sing, wanna swing on the stage and shine
Yeah, I want it all
I want my dreams, want the things that love can't buy
Yeah, I want it all (from you)
Bye, bye, baby
Bye, bye, bye

[verse 2]
It's a love story for the new age
For the sixth page
We're on a quick, sick rampage
Wining and dining, drinking and driving
Excessive buying, overdose and dying
On our drugs, and our love, and our dreams, and our rage
Blurring the lines between real and the fake
Dark and lonely, I need somebody to hold me
He will do very well
I can tell, I can tell
Keep me safe in his belltower hotel

[whisper]
Money is the anthem of success
So put on mascara and your party dress

[pre-Chorus]
I'm the national anthem
Boy, put your hands up
Give me a standing ovation
Boy, you have landed
Babe, in the land of sweetness and danger
Queen of Saigon
He says to be cool and I know he means it
He's loving my look
And I'm loving all his strategic ways
I said "do you think you'll kill for me one day?"
(Yes, of course I will, my darling)

[Chorus]
And I want it all
I want the rings and bling and the sweet skyline
Yeah, I want it all (from you)
I wanna sing, wanna swing on his stage and shine
Yeah, I want it all
I want my dreams, want the things that love can't buy
Yeah, I want it all (from you)
Bye, bye, baby
Bye, bye, bye

[outro]
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
I'm your national anthem, national anthem
I'm your national anthem, national anthem


Title: I Want You to Play with Me*

Lyrics:
I want you to play with me
I want you to play with me
I want you to play with me
I want you to play with me
I want you to play with me
I want you to play with me
I want you to play with me


Title: I Was In a Bad Way

Lyrics:
Wait, wait, for me
Wait, wait, wait, for me
Come on, baby

I was in a bad way, honey
Til I met you
I was in a bad place, honey
I need you

I was going nowhere fast, you were bringing me down
I wanted to go, you were the cutest guy in town

Wait, wait, wait, for me
I don't wanna go
Wait for me
I wanna go, I wanna go
Wait for me
I wanna go

I was in a bad way, honey
I was in a bad way, I was in a bad way

Bring it on punk, you know that I want it
I'm not a bad girl but when I go to clubs, I want to flaunt it
I feel like, you're Superman, and I'm not
It's on your terms, we can waste all my time
Because I want you, I want to go with you
Don't leave me here, I want to go with you

Can I be your babydoll, my my
Can I be your cherry pie
Why do all the best girls like bad guys
Cause they're to die for

I know what they say about you, you know that I never care
You were always my type with your dark heart and your long, black hair, yeah
Baby, I wanna take you higher, higher
So let me, so let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me love you
Let me love you, let me love you

I don't wanna go
Take me with you
I don't wanna go away, no
Take me with you

I need you, I want you, you know that


Title: I Will Follow You Into the Dark

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Benjamin Gibbard]
Love of mine, someday you will die
But I'll be close behind, I'll follow you into the dark
No blinding light or tunnels to gates of white
Just our hands clasped so tight, waiting for the hint of a spark

[Chorus: Benjamin Gibbard & Both]
If Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied
Illuminate the "no"s on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

[Verse 2: Lana Del Rey]
In Catholic school, as vicious as Roman rule
I got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black
And I held my tongue as she told me, "Son
Fear is the hеart of love," so I never wеnt back

[Chorus: Benjamin Gibbard & Lana Del Rey]
If Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied
Illuminate the "no"s on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

[Verse 3: Benjamin Gibbard & Both]
You and me have seen everything to see
From Bangkok to Calgary and the soles of your shoes
Are all worn down, the time for sleep is now
But it's nothing to cry about
'Cause we'll hold each other soon
In the blackest of rooms
[Chorus: Benjamin Gibbard & Lana Del Rey]
And if Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied
And illuminate the "no"s on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

[Outro: Benjamin Gibbard]
Then I'll follow you into the dark


Title: Jealous Girl

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]

Title: Jesus is My Boyfriend

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
He's Jesus Christ
And I’m his babydoll
I'm his favourite human but he saved them all

[Pre-Chorus]
He's my personal saviour
He's my personal saviour

[Chorus]
Jesus is my boyfriend
Jesus is my boyfriend
Jesus is my boyfriend
Jesus is my boyfriend

[Verse 2]
He's my personal saviour
He's my personal angel
My God thinks I’m smashing
He thinks I’m fine
My God takes me dashing cross the party line

[Verse 3]
He's my personal saviour
He's my personal saviour
My God treats me special
Gives me lots of things
I had some of his boyfriends offer diamond rings

[Verse 4]
He's my personal saviour
He's my personal saviour
He's my personal angel
He's my cherry pie
Said to call him "Dick Tracy"
He's my private eye
When I get in my gown
He comes to me in the night


Title: Jeu vidéo

Lyrics:
[Couplet 1]
Embarque dans mon vieux char
Couche-toé sur mes remords
L’ivresse est stallée sur ta peau
J’ouvrirai une bonne bouteille
On suivra le soleil
Comme dans Grand Theft Auto
Enfile ta plus belle robe
Mon costard va faire la job
La vie est un jeu vidéo

[Refrain]
Tu fais buzzer mon œil magique à chacun de tes mouvements
Je te l’ai dit souvent, les chemins sont à faire jusqu’à ton cœur
Je viendrai sous les traits du défricheur
L’amour ne veut plus de tricheurs
Chérie, as-tu vu?
Le monde est absurde selon Camus
Mais tes pouvoirs me prouve qu’il ne l’est plus
Le meilleur a devancé sa venue
La méfiance est portée disparue

[Couplet 2]
On fera pas nos divas
Mets le bonheur sur mon bras
Laisse-moi devenir ton héros
Si l’éternité existe
On s’inscrira sur sa liste
Pour faire durer nos échos
Je serai ton premier d’classe
Reste encore dans mon espace
La vie est un jeu vidéo

[Refrain]
Tu fais buzzer mon œil magique à chacun de tes mouvements
Je te l’ai dit souvent, les chemins sont à faire jusqu’à ton cœur
Je viendrai sous les traits du défricheur
L’amour ne veut plus de tricheurs
Chérie, as-tu vu?
Le monde est absurde selon Camus
Mais tes pouvoirs me prouve qu’il ne l’est plus
Le meilleur a devancé sa venue
La méfiance est portée disparue


Title: JFK

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
You smell like a million roses
Bathed in rock 'n' roll
Ours was the greatest
Love story ever told
Throat like an angel with a voice that was made of gold
That's my baby

[Verse 2]
He was the king of the town
With a crown that would never fall
A heart that would beat
Like a bass for his baby doll
One in a million, inimitable soul
That's my baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Young or old, summer or cold
Young or old, summer or cold

[Chorus]
You've got a way
Like JFK when you do it
The way that you move it
Spins me around like a record, baby
And you've got a soul like no one I know
You're so new at it
The way you see through that shit
Breaks my heart, and it drives me crazy

[Verse 3]
He was the king of the town
With a crown that would never fall
A heart like a bass that would beat for his baby doll
Mind like a diamond
An un-imitable song
That's my baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Young or old, summer or cold
Young or old, summer or cold

[Chorus]
You've got a way
Like JFK when you do it
The way that you move it
Spins me around like a record, baby
And you've got a soul like no one I know
You're so new at it
The way you see through that shit
Breaks my heart, and it drives me crazy
It drives me crazy

[Bridge]
You've got it
And I want it
Late summer nights in July, flaunt it
You know that you can always come home
To the one who gave you your name
'Cause I see a light in your eyes
It's so bright, and
The skies, they open wide for you
So come to me, my baby

[Chorus]
You've got a way
Like JFK when you do it
The way that you move it
Spins me around like a record, baby
And you've got a soul like no one I know
You're so new at it
The way you see through that shit
Breaks my heart, and it drives me crazy

[Outro]
It drives me crazy
It drives me crazy
Crazy, oh, oh-oh


Title: Jimmy Gnecco

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I say, "Hey, Jimmy Gnecco
I like the way your name echo
You are so fine"
I say, "Hey, Jimmy Gnecco
Do you wanna help me let go
Of my dark mind?"

[Chorus]
If you want it, it's yours
It's free, but of course
You're my sunshine
I say, "J, you're the boss
Without you I'm lost
You're my sunshine"
[Verse 3]
I say, "Hey, Jimmy Gnecco
You are on another level
You are so fine"
I say, "Hey Jimmy, let's go
I've been in love since I met you

It's free, but of course
Take a high ride

Without you I'm lost
You're my sunshine."

Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, take me to the park
Buy me a hot dog, kiss me in the dark, dark
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, take me to the park
Buy me cotton candy, kiss me in the dark

[Verse 4]
I say, "Hey, Jimmy Gnecco
Hey, I like your heavy metal
Do you like mine?”
I said, "Hey, Jimmy Gnecco
You were smashing from the get-go
This is your time"

[Chorus]
If you want it, it's yours
It's free, but of course
Take a high ride
I say, "J, you're the boss
Without you I'm lost
You're my sunshine”

Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, take me to the park
Buy pink cotton candy and kiss me in the dark, dark
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, take me to the park
Buy me something pretty and kiss me in the dark

Title: Joan and Bobby

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Joan said something:
"Don't feel too bad being weird"
She said she and Bobby adieu
Were going home again
'Cause everyone around here is crazy
Everyone's a big [?]

Joan, wait
Sometimes just a little movement
Is all it takes, but
You'll go, wish you wouldn't leave me
I wish you didn't need a break, but okay

[Chorus]
Sometimes you just know
When it's your time to go
When you can't live any longer
And you can't do any more
And sometimes you're afraid, but you wish
You want me to promise, have a new song
And a prayеr

[Verse 2]
While the velvеteens are changing
There was something cold in the wind
Joan just kept on clueing
"When you try to dry, we may be friends again"
Even though she had a feeling that
Deep inside she somehow knew
The dog would never come back wailing, no
That was not the kinda thing he'd do

Joan's about telling me something uplifting
I'm so confused
Everyone around here in town is leaving
Now even you
Now even you

Last night, I said it to her, I said
"Please help me die"
Wrong hole I got born in
I know she never had what I want
She only want what's good for me
She might know by now
He just smiled from the stormy skies
"You'll figure it out, you'll figure it out"

[Chorus]
And I think that I know that it's my time to go
I can't wait any longer
And I can't do any more
Wheter I'm afraid, but you know I'm gonna leave anyway

Title: Joshy and I

Lyrics:
When you play the bass, I get this feeling
Just like the way, just like I'm dreaming
Out on the way, [?] another babe
How do I do it?

When you play the bass, I get this feeling
Baby
Never mind

You play the bass, I get this feeling
Sick from the wave, so hard to reel in
Roll me up a little cigarette, give me some of that, babe
Roll me up a little cigarette, give me some of that, babe

You play the bass, I get this feeling
Sick from the wave, so hard to reel in
Roll me up a little cigarette, give me some of that, babe
Roll me up a little cigarette, give me some of that, babe

When you play the bass, I get this feeling
My heart starts to race
Roll me up a little cigarette, give me some of that, babe
Roll me up a little cigarette, give me some of that, babe

So pretty

You play the bass
Don't say no, just let me go
Baby
I don't know
Lie me down
When you play the bass
I get this feeling
Heart starts to race


Title: Judah Smith Interlude

Lyrics:
[Spoken Word: Judah Smith, Lana Del Rey]
Don't you understand what that means?
It means quit lusting after your neighbor
That's a heck of a life
You get to love your children in front of you
You get to love
You ever talk to somebody
"I want a new life"
"I don't love my wife anymore"
"I don't love my kids anymore"
"I'm missing out on life"
They're usually my age
Does that sound like love?
It's a life dominated with lust
And for too long, they've been holding it off
And finally, they just get weak and they say
"It doesn't matter anymore"
And the Spirit of God says
"I'll infuse you with dеsires for what you have
And what's in front of you" (Yeah, yеah, yeah)
(Desires for what you have)
So, as He works deep in your heart
As you call out to Him and say
"I'm here, do it in me, Man"
"Help me want what I got"
"Help me love what's in front of me"
"Help me want more of my wife and more of my friends"
"And help me serve the city I live in and not wish it away and hope I can move"
"Help me, God"
"I wanna be a man of love, not a man of lust"
But you've gotta do that
So I bring you to this verse and I'm done, I'm done
Psalms, chapter eight
And you know where I got this verse?
This is gonna sound crazy to you, but I'm gonna tell you the absolute truth
It's gonna make me sound so spiritual, so I'm looking forward to it
I woke up this morning and God said, "Check the Bible app"
I don't know if it was God, but it felt like God
And I had the thought in my head, “Check the Bible app”
I'm gonna speak to you from the verse of the day
That means I don't have to do anything
I don't have to look anywhere, I just get the verse of the day
So I get to the verse of the day
And here's the verse of the day, today, in the Bible app
Look at this (That's cool)
"Look at the splendor of the skies
Your creative genius glowing in the heavens
When I gaze, when I gaze at Your moon and Your stars
Mounted like jewels in their settings
I know You are the fascinating artist who fashioned it all"
When I look up and I see such wonder and workmanship above
"I have to ask this question"
"I've gotta ask this question"
Compared to all this cosmic glory
"Why would you ever bother with puny, mortal man?" or be
Ooh, don't get me started on it
I could preach for another hour on infatuated
Or be infatuated with Adam's son
"Why are you so infatuated with me?"
You're the star creator, You're the ocean maker (Yeah, yeah)
You're the whale creator, you're the rhino designer
Who, who are you? (Rhino designer)
And then it goes on in verse five
And it says
"Yet, what honor You have given to me
Created only a little lower than Elohim"
Which is the name of Creator God, Artist God
You wanna call God "Artist"?
At some point tonight, before you go to bed, go, "Yo, Elohim"
And He'll hear, "You're the best Artist ever"
"The little Elohim, crowned like kings and queens with glory and magnificence
You have delighted, You have delegated to them
Mastery over all You have made"
You have made me a partner with You
I used to think my preaching was mostly about You
And you're not gonna like this, but I'm gonna tell you the truth
I've discovered my preaching is mostly about me


Title: Jump

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Palm trees in black and white
Last thing I saw before I died
Palm trees in black and white
Was the last thing I saw before I died
Bright light, right man
Right mixture of cocaine and heroin

[Chorus]
Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you, do you wanna?

[Verse 2]
Hair thinnin' in the wind
Cadillac convertible with him
All shot at 2 a.m.
You got the grin of a very old man

[Chorus]
Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you, do you wanna?

[Verse 3]
Palm trees in black and white
You are a junkie on your window smilin' wide
Palm trees in black and white
Lean forward and you close your eyes
Last fight, fuck them
Last words before you went under again

[Chorus]
Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you, do you, do you wanna?

[Outro]
Just do what you love
Just do what you can
Just do what you love
Just do what you can
Just do what you love
Do it better than
Just do what you love
Do it better than
(Do you wanna?
Do you, do you wanna?
Jump, jump, jump)


Title: Junky Pride

Lyrics:
You have this way of making me
Say the opposite of everything I mean
I kiss you, I hug you
But I could not feel less connected from you

[Chorus]
I know I wanted
All this in the beginning, I really tried
I know I caught you
At a not-so-happy time of your life
My dreams are bigger than your junky pride

I don’t quite fit the part of
She who loses everything and falls into insanity
The sun beams mean nothing
If you can’t find the light shining in one thing

[Chorus]

It’s fine if you’re hateful
As long as all-in-all you remain grateful
It made me nervous to know you didn't like me
I really tried
The way I’m feeling in this moment
It can’t last my whole life

My dreams are bigger than your junky pride

Title: Kinda Outta Luck

Lyrics:
[Intro]
I was born bad, but then I met you
You made me nice for a while
But my dark side's true
You never cared what I did at all
Motel singer or the silver pole
I did what I had to do

[Verse 1]
Femme fatale, always on the run
Diamonds on my wrist
Whiskey on my tongue
Before I get bad, I gotta get drunk
So get over here
Pour me a cold one

[Pre-Chorus]
Babe, you can see that I'm danger
Teetering off of the stage, yeah
Sparkling in sequins, say, hey-yeah
Time to give in to the kindness of strangers

[Chorus]
Is it wrong, wrong that I think it's kinda fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun?
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back, but I'm flat outta luck
Is it wrong, wrong that I think it's kinda fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun?
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back, but I'm kinda outta luck

[Verse 2]
Wrong, I know, killing someone
It gets a little easier when you've done it once
You know that I'm fun, you know that I'm young
So tell me you're mine
Let's get it on

[Pre-Chorus]
Babe, you can see that I'm danger
Glamorous but I'm deranged, yeah
Teetering off of the stage, yeah
I said it really nicely, so can you be my savior?

[Chorus]
Is it wrong, wrong that I think it's kinda fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun?
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back, but I'm flat outta luck
Is it wrong, wrong that I think it's kinda fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun?
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back, but I'm kinda outta luck

[Bridge]
I was a dangerous girl
You were too nice for this world
And now I'm back on the prowl
Who wants to give it a whirl?

[Chorus]
Is it wrong, wrong that I think it's kinda fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun?
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back, but I'm flat outta luck
Is it wrong, wrong that I think it's kinda fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun?
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back, but I'm kinda outta luck


Title: Kintsugi

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
There's a certain point the body can't come back from
In one year, we've learned the turn of the mouth
The depth that the chest cavity takes
Chucky was there for three out of three
I was there for the third 'cause I couldn't be
There for the one who was closest to me
But I can't say I run when things get hard
It's just that I don't trust myself with my heart
But I've had to let it break a little more
'Cause they say that's what it's for

[Chorus]
That's how the light shines in
That's how the light shines in
That's how the light gets in (Mm-mm)

[Verse 2]
So everyone was there, they were standin', laughin'
And I'm on the side with my tears streamin' down
There's somethin' about the clutch of the wrist
He thought mine was his to cough into his mouth
We've only got hours
And I just can't stop cryin' 'cause all of the ways
When you see someone dyin'
The sea of your days flash in front of you
And you think about who would be with you
And then there's Donoghue

[Bridge 1]
Daddy, I miss them
I'm in the mountains
I'm probably runnin' away from the feelings I get
When I think all the things about them
Daddy, I miss them
I'm at the Roadrunner Café
I'm probably runnin' away from the thoughts in the day
That have things to do with them, but they say

[Chorus]
"That's how the light gets in
That's how the light gets in
That's how the light gets in"

[Verse 3]
Think by the third of March, I was cracked open
Finally, the ground was cold, they wouldn't open
Brought by the sunlight of the spirit to pour into me
There's a name for it in Japanese, it's "Kintsugi"
They sang folk songs from the '40s
Even the fourteen-year-old knew "Froggie Came A-Courtin'"
How do my blood relatives know all of these songs?
I don't know anyone left who knows songs that I sing

[Chorus]
That's how the light gets in
That's how the light gets in

[Bridge 2]
But, Daddy, I miss them
I'm at the Roadrunner Café
Probably runnin' away from the feelings today
In the snow-capped mountains of the desert
Daddy, I miss them
I'm in the mountains
Probably runnin' away, I've been meaning to say
That there's nothing to do except know that this is

[Outro]
How the light gets in
By cracking, the light gets in
It's how the light gets in
That's how the light gets in
That's how the light gets in
Then you're golden, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
Just another folk song, but anyway
I try so hard, but that's okay
It's how the light gets in
It's how the light gets in
It's how the light gets in

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
He don’t like no spotlight
He the kinda man, stand real quiet
He don’t wanna go, go home
He don’t wanna go, go home
He’s a sweet baby, but he looks mean
In his soft leather, and his blue jeans
He don’t wanna go, go
He don’t wanna go, go, go

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You are just an American boy
You got your youth and you got your dreams
You ride your Harley like there’s nothing to lose
You got the wind, but you’re not free

[Chorus]
And you don't wanna go, go home
I don’t wanna go, go home
We don’t wanna go, go home
Baby tonight
Baby tonight

[Verse 2]
He don’t like no small things
He be riding round on some tall dreams
He don’t wanna go, go home
Hе don’t wanna go, go home
Hollywood sun, small town things
Probably he’s changed, that’s why hе drinks
He don’t wanna go, go home
He don’t wanna go, go home

[Pre-Chorus 2]
He was just an American kid
Liked rock and roll and wanted to have fun
He felt the same way all of us did
Like probably he was the only one

[Chorus]
And you don't wanna go, go home
I won’t wanna go, go home
We won’t wanna go, go home
Baby tonight
Baby tonight

[Bridge]
I was just an American girl
I was reaching for the sun
I never really had big dreams when I saw you
Were my only one

[Chorus]
And I don't wanna go, go home
I don’t wanna go, go home
Baby tonight
Baby tonight
Baby tonight
Baby tonight


Title: Lana Del Rey - 24 (Русский перевод)

Lyrics:
[Перевод песни Lana Del Rey — «24»]

[Куплет 1]
Есть только 24 часов в дне
И половину способов для тебя мне наврать, мой малыш
Есть только 24 часов в дне
И половину из них ты лежишь наяву с мыслями об убийств и резни

[Предприпев]
Если ты лежишь с псами, получишь блохи
Обращай внимание о компании, которую ты держишь

[Припев]
Есть только 24 часов
И этого не хватает
Наврать как ты врёшь
Или любить как ты любишь

[Постприпев]
Хммм, хммм
Хммм, хммм

[Куплет 2]
Есть только 24 часов в дне
И половину из них ты лижишь
Под простынью со мной, моя лижачая любовь
"Есть только 24 часов",  ты бы сказкал
Большенство из них ты платишь
За всё за что они тебе заплатили, моя любовь

[Предприпев]
Если ты лежишь с псами, получишь блохи
Берегись о тех кого ты ришаешь покидать

[Припев]
Есть только 24 часов
И этого не хватает
Наврать как ты врёшь
Или любить как ты любишь

[Постприпев]
Хммм, хммм
Хммм, хммм

[Бридж]
Дай мне твоего тепла
Дай мне твои алмазы
Ты боришься на улицу
И с моими кривыми словами
Ты считаешь до трёх
Покуда они умирают
Тебя трудно добраться
Ты холодный на ощупь

[Аутро]
Ла-да-да-да-да-да
Ла-да-да-да-да-да
Ла-да-да-ди-да-да-да

Lyrics:
Alcohol/drinkingI can be your champagne wine
Pick me up and make a toast
Champagne in the air
Fix me up a mixed drink, Bacardi

I been drinkin' Jack and Coke a lot
'Cause I just wanna dream, I just wanna drink
Come on, get drunk
You know you wanna
Open up a beer, you say, "Get over here
And play a video game"
Drinking in the small town firelight
(Pabst Blue Ribbon on ice)
We were skipping school and drinking on the job
With the boss
Drinking cherry schnapps in the velvet night
You sitting, sipping on your Black Cristal, yeah
Cases of Bacardi chasers
Chasing me all over town
We're on a quick, sick rampage
Wining and dining, drinking and driving
Darling, darling
Doesn't have a problem lying to herself
'Cause her liquor's top shelf
Drink all day and we talk 'til dark
(Blue Ribbons on ice)
Play them like guitars, you're like one of my toys
It's so crazy, I could drink it like tequila sunrise
Get out that whiskey
Pour it right quickly
Drink lime green, stay up 'til dawn
Your favorite liquor off the top-shelf
Wine is flowing with Bacardi
Like if you heard I was out in the bars drinkin' Jack and Coke
You just crack another beer
And pretend that you're still hereAmerica/patriotismDirect reference to "Come When You Call Me America"
I'm America's Sweetheart

We were two kids livin' life on the run
Like the American dream, baby
Italian alloy, classical American
And I'm America's sweetheart
We were two kids just tryin' to get out
Lived on the dark side of the American dream

Crazy as since I was three
Tell me do you think that's wrong?
Don't cry, honey, crazy girl
Go out every night whenever I feel sad
All this drive-by love got me crazy like a drug
No man can keep me together
Been broken since I was born
Call me before I get stupid
Make me uncrazy like you did
Summer’s almost over, baby
Everybody thinks I’m crazy
You like your girls insane
Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
You're a careless con and you're a crazy liar, but baby
I tried so hard to act nice like a lady
You taught me that it was good to be crazy
I'm tired of feeling like I'm fucking crazy
Ah, he's in the sky with diamonds and he’s making me crazy
You make me crazy, you make me wild
You're fucking crazy
Oh, oh

Blue eyes and jazz and attitude
Sun and ocean blue
Their magnificence, it don't make sense to you
Say you want me too
Dark blue

Flames so hot that they turn blue
Everything looks better from above, my king

All in your car for

As long as you got the Chevrolet, I will ride
Direct reference to "Driving In Cars With Boys"
Mommy's Mercedes or Billy's pickup truck

Driving in your fast car
Pick me up
In a pickup truck
Roll it down
You got it going on
We could drive forever, my baby
We could leave it all and never look back
If you wanted heaven, baby
Sit back in my pink cadillac
Drive me in your car until the sky gets big
Swinging in the backyard, pull up in your fast car
Baby stopping at 7-Eleven
There in his white Pontiac Heaven
I'm feelin' electric tonight
Cruisin' down the coast goin' 'bout 99
Even if you're gone, I'm gonna drive, drive, drive
Take me to the Hamptons, Bugatti Veyron
Drive fast, I can almost taste it now
I drive fast, wind in my hair
I push it to the limits cause I just don't care
I'm driving fast, flash!
Everyone knows it
Gold chains, kissing fly, leaning on your chrome ride
And your white Corvette under willow trees
Hawaiian tropic, dark, and a bottle of jack in the Cadillac
As I drive down the highway
He lives in California too
He drives a Chevy Malibu
Red racing cars, Sunset and Vine
We could cruise to the blues
Wilshire Boulevard if we choose
And we could cruise to the news
Pico Boulevard in your used
Little bullet car if we choose
Carry me home, got my new car and my gun
Wind in my hair, holding your hand, listen to a song
Left the canyon, drove to the club
You've got a Thunderbird, my daddy had one tooCelebrities/iconsWe're like Sid and Nancy loving the fight
You are my Axl Rose husband
Direct reference to "Elvis"

Or see Van Halen at their reunion show
Heavy metal hour on T.V
Diamond Dave and Ray Lee

I belong to a bygone era
Like the Scarlett O'Hara of the downtown scene
It was like James Dean for sure

Elvis is the best, hell yes
Elvis is my daddy

Title: Last Girl on Earth

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Baby has a broken heart
She can't belong to only one
Until another girl is found
I don't pay for anything
My cigarettes or diamonds rings
My feet don't even touch the ground

[Pre-Chorus]
Chariots of gold, I ride with Jay-Z, Jared Leto
I'm a superpower, now they call me the tornado
I got roses in my hair, I belly dance, and do the tango
Sometimes I get lonely, everybody told me no

[Chorus]
No one lives forever, but that's no reason to give up
Don't you wanna fall in love?
No such thing as heaven
And I'm the last girl on Earth
So baby, let's get it on

[Verse 2]
Cleopatra used to rule
But she got nothing on me now
'Cause I'm the last girl on earth
I turn the television on
They only play my favorite song
Since I'm the last girl on Earth

[Pre-Chorus]
Chariots of gold, I'm sitting, sipping cherry cola
Caesar said he'd fall in love with me if I was older
I own all of Mexico and I got my own roller-coaster
Sometimes I get lonely, millions can hold me now

[Chorus]
No one lives forever, but that's no reason to give up
Don't you wanna fall in love?
No such thing as heaven
And I'm the last girl on Earth
So baby, let's get it on

[Bridge]
I stay up late at night, try not to think about it
Pretend I'm happy, ruling all the world without love
I get so tired being on display somehow
Sometimes I get lonely, but millions all know me now

[Chorus]
No one lives forever, but that's no reason to give up
Don't you wanna fall in love?
There's no such thing as heaven
And I'm the last girl on Earth
So baby, let's get it on
No such thing as heaven
And I'm the last girl on Earth
So baby, let's get it on

Title: LA Who Am I to Love You?

Lyrics:
I left my city for San Francisco
Took a free ride off a billionaire's jet
LA, I'm from nowhere, who am I to love you?
LA, I've got nothing, who am I to love you when I'm feeling this way and I've got nothing to offer?
LA, not quite the city that never sleeps
Not quite the city that wakes, but the city that dreams, for sure
If by dreams, you mean in nightmares

LA, I'm a dreamer, but I'm from nowhere, who am I to dream?
LA, I'm upset, I have complaints, listen to me
They say I came from money and I didn't
And I didn't even have love, and it's unfair
LA, I sold my life rights for a big check and I'm upset
And now I can't sleep at night and I don't know why
Plus, I love Zach, so why did I do that when I know it won't last?

LA, I picked San Francisco because the man who doesn't love me lives there
LA, I'm pathetic, but so are you, can I come home now?
Daughter to no one, table for one
Party of thousands of people I don't know at Delilah where my ex-husband works
I'm sick of this, but can I come home now?
Mother to no one, private jet for one
Back home to the Tudor house that borned a thousand murder plots
Hancock Park, it's treated me very badly, I'm resentful
The witch on the corner, the neighbor nobody wanted
The reason for Garcetti's extra security

LA, I know I'm bad, but I have nowhere else to go, can I come home now?
I never had a mother, will you let me make the sun my own for now, and the ocean my son?
I'm quite good at tending to things despite my upbringing, can I raise your mountains?
I promise to keep them greener, make them my daughters
Teach them about fire, warn them about water
I'm lonely, LA, can I come home now?

I left my city for San Francisco
And I'm writing from the Golden Gate Bridge
But it's not going as I planned
I took a free ride off a billionaire and brought my typewriter
And promised myself that I would stay, but
It's just not going the way that I thought
It's not that I feel different, and I don't mind that it's not hot
It's just that I belong to no one, which means there's only one place for me
The city not quite awake, the city not quite asleep
The city that's still deciding how good it can be

And also
I can't sleep without you
No one's ever really held me like you
Not quite tightly, but certainly, I feel your body next to me
Smoking next to me
Vaping lightly next to me
And I love that you love the neon lights like me
Orange in the distance
We both love that
And I love that we have that in common
Also, neither one of us can go back to New York
For you are unmoving
As for me, it won't be my city again until I'm dead
Fuck the New York Post

LA, who am I to need you when I've needed so much, asked for so much?
And what I've been given, I'm not sure yet
I may never know that either until I'm dead
For now, though, what I do know
Is although I don't deserve you
Not you at your best and your splendor
With towering eucalyptus trees that sway in my dominion
Not you at your worst
Totally on fire, unlivable, unbreathable, I need you
You see, I have no mother
And you do
A continental shelf
A larger piece of land from where you came
And I?
I'm an orphan
A little seashell that rests upon your native shores
One of many, for sure
But because of that, I surely must love you closely to the most of anyone

For that reason, let me love you
Don't mind my desperation
Let me hold you, not just for vacation
But for real and for forever
Make it real life
Let me be a real wife to you
Girlfriend, lover, mother, friend
I adore you
Don't be put off by my quick-wordedness
I'm generally quite quiet
Quite a meditator, actually
I'll do very well down by Paramhansa Yogananda's realization center, I'm sure
I promise you'll barely even notice me
Unless you want to notice me
Unless you prefer a rambunctious child
In which case, I can turn it on too
I'm quite good on the stage as you may know
You might have heard of me

So either way, I'll fit in just fine
So just love me by doing nothing
And perhaps, by not shaking the county line
I'm yours if you'll have me
But regardless, you're mine

Title: Let Me Love You Like A 33 Year Old Faggot

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I come from LA, how about you?
I only mention it 'cause I wanted to feel superior letting you know that I come from a popular city
And I want you to come
Eighty miles North or South
I suck in geography
But I don't care where as long as you know it
And as long as you aren't a creep that will lock me in his basement

[Chorus]
Let Me Love You Like A 33 Year Old Faggot That Still Lives With Their Mum And Argues With Her 24/7 And Has A Thigh Gap With Uneven Eyebrows And A Nose That Changes Shape In Every Pic Because Of The Lighting And Wears Heels Everyday And Will Have To Take Feet Surgery When Older Because He Won’t Be Able To Walk

[Verse 2]
I come from a big place far away
I only mention it 'cause I wanted to feel superior telling you that I come from far away
And I want you to come
I guess I could manage if you know geography, because I don't
If you do I can see myself having fun, except if you're a creep that will lock me in his basement

[Chorus]
Let Me Love You Like A 33 Year Old Faggot That Still Lives With Their Mum And Argues With Her 24/7 And Has A Thigh Gap With Uneven Eyebrows And A Nose That Changes Shape In Every Pic Because Of The Lighting And Wears Heels Everyday And Will Have To Take Feet Surgery When Older Because He Won’t Be Able To Walk

[Bridge]
We could get lost in the purple rain
But I hope not because you may be a pedo
Talk about the good old days
But I hope not because you could dox me in some ways
We could get high on some pink champagne
But I hope not because you may be a pedo and you may rape me
Baby, let me count the days I have left to be worried while I think about you potentially not being a mentally stable person

[Chorus]
Let Me Love You Like A 33 Year Old Faggot That Still Lives With Their Mum And Argues With Her 24/7 And Has A Thigh Gap With Uneven Eyebrows And A Nose That Changes Shape In Every Pic Because Of The Lighting And Wears Heels Everyday And Will Have To Take Feet Surgery When Older Because He Won’t Be Able To Walk


Title: Let Me Love You Like A Woman

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I come from a small town, how 'bout you?
I only mention it 'cause I'm ready to leave LA
And I want you to come
Eighty miles north or south will do
I don't care where as long as you're with me
And I'm with you and you let me

[Chorus]
Let me love you like a woman
Let me hold you like a baby
Let me shine like a diamond
Let me be who I'm meant to be
Talk to me in poems and songs
Don't make me be bittersweet
Let me love you like a woman
Let me hold you like a baby
Let me hold you like a baby

[Verse 2]
I come from a small town far away
I only mention it 'cause I'm ready to leave LA
And I want you to come (And I need you to come)
I guess I could manage if you stay
It's just if you do, I can't see myself having any fun, so

[Chorus]
Let me love you like a woman
Let me hold you like a baby
Let me shine like a diamond
Let me be who I'm meant to be
Talk to me in songs and poems
Don't make me be bittersweet
Let me love you like a woman

[Post-Chorus]
Take you to infinity
Let me love you like a woman (Let me hold you like a baby)
Take you to infinity
Let me love you like a woman (Let me hold you like a baby)
Take you to infinity

[Bridge]
We could get lost in the purple rain
Talk about the good ol' days
We could get high on some pink champagne
Baby, let me count the ways

[Chorus]
Let me love you like a woman
Let me hold you like a baby
Let me shine like a diamond
Let me be who I'm meant to be
Talk to me in songs and poems
Don't make me be bittersweet
Let me love you like a woman

You get me moving like no one can
Get me moving like no one can


Title: Let The Light In

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Lana Del Rey]
Pick you up at home, quarter to three
Ask you if you want somethin' to eat
Drive around, get drunk, do it over again
Wake you up at night, quarter to one
I can never stop, wanna have fun
Don't be actin' like I'm the kinda girl who can sleep

[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
'Cause every time you say you're gonna go
I just smile, 'cause, babe, I already know
You know I got nothin' under this overcoat
[Chorus: Lana Del Rey & Father John Misty]
Ooh, let the light in
At your back door yelling 'cause I wanna come in
Ooh, turn your light on
Look at us, you and I, back at it again

[Verse 2: Lana Del Rey]
Pick you up around quarter to two
Usually we got nothin' to do
Screw it, maybe you should go and record some of your songs
Got my dress on tight 'cause you know that I
Look shinin' in the light, therе's so much ridin'
On this life and how we write a lovе song

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey & Father John Misty]
Ooh, let the light in
At your back door yelling 'cause I wanna come in
Ooh, turn your light on
Look at us, you and I, back at it again

[Bridge: Lana Del Rey]
'Cause I love to love, to love, to love you
I hate to hate, to hate, to hate you
Put the Beatles on, light the candles, go back to bed
'Cause I wanna, wanna, wanna want you
I need to, need to, need to need you
Put the TV on, the flowers in a vase, lie your head

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey & Father John Misty]
Ooh, let the light in
At your back door yelling 'cause I wanna come in
Ooh, turn your light on
Look at us, you and me, back at it again


Title: Life is Beautiful

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Don't be that way
Don't you pretend
You're not awake
When you know you are
I see the way
You're lying there
I know you can't
Be very far

[Pre-Chorus 1]
God wouldn’t do that
He knows how I feel
I can’t go through that
And so it’s not real

[Chorus]
Life is still so beautiful
Life is still so beautiful

[Verse 2]
Don't be so still
You never are
You like to play
Your soul's on fire
I don't believe this is the end
And I still feel your heart's desire

[Pre-Chorus 2]
God couldn’t do that
He knows you belong
To me and me only
And so I’ll be strong

[Chorus]
Life is still so beautiful
Life is still so beautiful

[Bridge]
Come on boy, let's go
We can hit the road
We don't have to say
Where we're going
We can go anywhere
We can go anywhere
We can go anywhere
Right now

[Chorus]
Life is still so beautiful
Life is still so beautiful


Title: Life Lesson

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Jon Batiste]
Never second-guess yourself
'Cause we were fallin', darling, from the start
Always listen to your heart
'Cause we were fallin' from the start

[Verse 2: Lana Del Rey, Both]
You're happy until you're not
You're icy until you're hot

[Verse 3: Lana Del Rey]
I read an article about a star who said that standing
In the shadow of her husband felt so dark
Reminded me of you and I because
That's very much the way our story was

[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey, Jon Batiste]
Because my biggest blessing (Yeah)
My biggest blessing

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
He got so mad, that in a flash
In just one sеcond
I became his life lеsson
I'm his life lesson now

[Verse 4: Jon Batiste]
Goin' through this world alone
Here 'til I right my wrongs
Shadow until the light
From the start, it was all and all
Fears of a place and time
When the space was made
And the stakes were laid
Say it again, I pray

[Verse 5: Lana Del Rey]
"What's your name?" I said when she came down
With auburn hair, her dress was long
She's not your type, it made me smile
And she's as sunny as the dawn

[Verse 6: Lana Del Rey, Jon Batiste, Both]
Get gone, get gone, get gone, get gone
She rocks a little red car like me, man, she belongs
She wears her hair like mine with the part in the middle and I think it's cute
But she could be the one to take my place (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey, Both]
She was my biggest blessing
She was my biggest blessing

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
I hope it's cold where you reside
You wake up late at night
And I would reckon
That you'd be guessing
I, I'm your life lesson

[Bridge: Jon Batiste]
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh

[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey, Both]
You were my biggest blessing
You were my biggest blessing

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey, Both]
It's like a dream, you know what I mean?
Things are peachy keen
This very second
And I would reckon
That now you know it


Title: Little Carmen

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
The boys, the girls, they all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God, her mind's like a diamond
Audio tune lies but she's still shinin', shinin', shinin'

[Chorus]
Darlin', darlin', doesn't have a problem
Lyin' to herself, says her liquor's top shelf
It's alarmin', honestly, how charmin' she can be
She's fooling everyone, tellin' 'em she's havin' fun

[Verse 2]
The night descends and there goes Carmen
Only seventeen but she walks the streets so mean
The men, they stop when she walks by 'em
Whisper "Who is she?" La princesa de la silence
Her walk is art, her words are lightnin'
Strikin' everyone when she pass by them

[Chorus]
Carmen, darlin', doesn't have a problem
She's lyin' to herself 'cause her liquor's top shelf
It's alarmin', honestly, how charmin' she can be
She's foolin' everyone, tellin' 'em she's havin' fun

[Bridge]
She looks animated like a cartoon baby
With her tiara smile and her shortcake heart
Yo, she looks animated like a cartoon baby
With her champagne sex and her cocaine heart
She's like a light that you can't turn off
Gettin' too bright and you need to stop
But you can't turn off and you're gettin' hot
And your body keeps twistin', movin', twistin', movin', shakin', yeah
Twistin', movin', shakin', yeah
Dance 'til dawn, yeah, you dance 'til you drop

[Chorus]
Carmen, Carmen, doesn't have a problem
Lyin' to herself 'cause her liquor's top shelf
Oh, it's alarmin', honest, how disarmin' she can be
You're foolin' everyone when inside you know you're dyin'

[Outro]
Carmen, Carmen, doesn't have a problem
Lyin' to herself 'cause her liquor's top shelf


Title: Living Legend

Lyrics:
[Intro]
Hmm, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Blackbirds will sing in the same key
As you play in the shoes that I bought you
And sweet baby Jane don't know a thing
About my songs, but she knows I'm a monsoon

[Chorus]
And, baby, you, all the things you do
And the ways you move, send me straight to Heaven
And, baby, you, what you never knew
What I never said is you're my living legend

[Verse 2]
Hipsters will sing just like a dream
In Sin-é or the back Brooklyn bayou
But you never cared about my name
And, darling, I never meant to defy you

[Chorus]
But baby, you, all them things you do
And those ways you moved, send me straight to Heaven
And baby you, I never said to you
You really are my living legend

[Bridge]
I got guns in the summertime and horses, too
Guns in the summertime and horses, too
I never meant to be bad or unwell
I was just living on the edge
Right between Heaven and Hell
And I'm tired of it

[Chorus]
Oh, all the things you do
And the ways you move, send me straight to Heaven
And, baby, you, what I never said to you
'Cause you really are my living legend

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
My living legend
My living legend
My living legend
My living legend


Title: Living with Myself

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Jonathan Wilson]
I'm living with the fear of God every single day
I'm living with myself, I know not enough of whom I speak
I'm living like the Sheriff man patrolling this dirty boulevard
Hey, look, these Aviators, man, they completely cover my

[Chorus: Jonathan Wilson]
I'm sailing on the air sometimes
And I'm really breathing deep this time

[Post-Chorus: Jonathan Wilson & Lana Del Rey]
But then it comes (comes, comes)
That same old nagging feeling
I need to do wrong (wrong, wrong)
The lies, I start to believe them

[Verse 2: Jonathan Wilson]
I'm living with my purest pleasures as my memories
I'm living with a mess, I guess, I'll never even clean
I'm loving when I slide my hands inside a dirty deck of cards
Hey, look, these Aviators, man, they completely cover my

[Chorus: Jonathan Wilson]
I'm sailing on the air sometimes
And I'm really breathing deep this time
I'm sailing on the air sometimes
And I'm really breathing deep this time

[Bridge: Jonathan Wilson]
I know there was a place so long ago
Where I could go to find faith and purity
But nothing that sweet could ever inspire me
These darker thoughts, they are now guiding me

[Post-Chorus: Jonathan Wilson & Lana Del Rey]
So it goes (goes, goes)
That same old nagging feeling
To do wrong (wrong, wrong)
The lies, I start to believe them, oh

[Outro: both, Lana Del Rey]
I'm living with myself, I guess
I'm living with myself, I guess
I'm living with myself, I guess
I'm living with myself, I guess
I'm living with myself, I guess
I'm living with myself, I guess


Title: Living Without You

Lyrics:
[Verse]
If you get lonely, darling just hold me
Prison isn’t going to keep me from you
Do like you told me, pick up and phone me
Use your one phone call and your ex-love boo
Nobody will have to know, that our love’s alive
Keep it on the low if you want to hide
I’ve got the same address that you left behind
On Greenwich Avenue, wishing and dreaming of you

[Chorus]
Living without you is like TV in black and white
Dark when I found you, touch me and turned on the light
When I’m around you, suddenly I realize
That I was blind before I saw the world through your eyes

[Verse]
If you get lonely think of this only
Heaven hasn’t forgotten about you
Remember Coney Island and how we
Went into the waves until the water’s blue
I won’t tell a single soul that you cry at night
Sit in single cells holding that pillow tight
Baby think of home, it will be alright
If you feel sad remember what we have

[Chorus]
Living without you is like TV in black and white
Dark when I found you, touch me to turn on the light
When I’m around you, suddenly I realize
That I was blind before I saw the world through your eyes

[Verse]
Being without you’s like when to live, no reprieve
Somewhere I’ve found you, flower bloom and I believe
That I have felt true love, I hope you never leave, never leave
So dry your eyes, dry your eyes
No bad surprises left in stored for you
And when you get home
You can change the tides and start anew, start anew
New new new new

[Chorus]
Living without you is like TV in black and white
Dark when I found you, touch me to turn on the light
When I’m around you, suddenly I realize
That I was blind before I saw the world through your eyes


Title: Lizzy Del Rey

Lyrics:
Hi I'm Lizzy Grant
(Hi Lizzy Grant!)
Hello!
I gave bob a list of songs that he wanted me to play cause he wanted one but I'm going to change them all
(Oh Yeah)
(music turn on)
So the first song is called Disc....

Don't cut your wrist
Don't use your fist
Please stay a while

Move Baby Move Baby
I'm In Love

I cry a lot
Wounded I fought
These friends don't care

Move baby Move baby
I'm in love

And I love my demons
Cause they act Angels
Angels Are Demons Decorated
Move baby Move baby
I'm in love

Move baby Move baby
I'm in love

(Lana Del Rey Singing...)
Thank you
(Applause)


Title: Loaded

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Tripping on the sidewalk
Living like a cyclone
Was I in your heart?
Guess I’ll never know where you go
Harsh words in the headlamps
Time to leave

[Verse 2]
Racing like a psycho
Walking on a tightrope
Funky like a monkey
With my makeup running
Too proud to find no time to breathe

[Chorus]
My baby's always threatening to leave
You can do that or be here
Almost brought me down to my knees
You said I've never been clear
Honey, you better believe
Now that there's nothing to fear
You can just leave

(Guitar solo)

[Verse 3]
Walking like I'm tanked up
Reading from the black book
Everyone you know is a roady-go sinner
You look away as they crucify me
Sleeping in the wreckage
Loaded like a weapon
Bombing down jacina like the end is coming
I prophesize you'll miss the highs with me

[Chorus]
My baby's always threatening to leave
You can do that or be here
Almost brought me down to my knees
You said I've never been clear
Honey, you better believe
Now that there's nothing to fear
You can just leave

[Bridge]
Would you say my prayers
If I came here ill-prepared
You can paint it all black
'cause you're never gonna get it clear
When it's easier to leave
When it's easier to leave
(Too tired to try to let it go)

[Chorus]
My baby's always threatening to leave
You can do that or be here
Almost brought me down to my knees
(Too tired to try to let it go)
You said I've never been clear
Honey, you better believe
Now that there's nothing to fear
You can just leave

[Outro]
Too tired to try to let it go
Too tired to try to let it go
Too tired to try to let it go
Too tired to try to let it go
Too tired to try to let it go


Title: Lolita

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Would you be mine? Would you be my baby tonight?
Could be kissin' my fruit punch lips in the bright sunshine
'Cause I like you quite a lot, everything you got, don't you know?
It's you that I adore, though I make the boys fall like dominoes

[Pre-Chorus]
Kiss me in the D-A-R-K, dark tonight
(D-A-R-K, do it my way)
Kiss me in the P-A-R-K, park tonight
(P-A-R-K, let them all say)

[Chorus]
Hey Lolita, hey, hey Lolita, hey
I know what the boys want, I'm not gonna play
Hey Lolita, hey, hey Lolita, hey
Whistle all you want, but I'm not gonna stay
No more skippin' rope, skippin' heartbeats with the boys downtown
Just you and me feelin' the heat even when the sun goes down

[Verse 2]
I could be yours, I could be your baby tonight
Topple you down from your sky forty stories high
Shinin' like a God, can't believe I caught you and so
Look at what I bought, not a second thought, oh, Romeo

[Pre-Chorus]
Kiss me in the D-A-R-K, dark tonight
(D-A-R-K, do it my way)
Kiss me in the P-A-R-K, park tonight
(P-A-R-K, let them all say)

[Chorus]
Hey Lolita, hey, hey Lolita, hey
I know what the boys want, I'm not gonna play
Hey Lolita, hey, hey Lolita, hey
Whistle all you want, but I'm not gonna stay
No more skippin' rope, skippin' heartbeats with the boys downtown
Just you and me feelin' the heat even when the sun goes down

[Bridge]
I, I-I want my cake and I wanna eat it too
I-I want to have fun and be in love with you
I, I, I know that I'm a mess with my long hair
And my suntan, short dress, bare feet, I don't care
What they say about me, what they say about me
Because I know that it's L-O-V-E
You make me happy, you, you make me happy
And I never listen to anyone
(Let them all say)

[Chorus]
Hey Lolita, hey, hey Lolita, hey
I know what the boys want, I'm not gonna play
Hey Lolita, hey, hey Lolita, hey
Whistle all you want, but I'm not gonna stay
No more skippin' rope, skippin' heartbeats with the boys downtown
Just you and me feelin' the heat even when the sun goes down


Title: Looking For America

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Took a trip to San Francisco
All  our friends said we would jive
Didn't  work, so I left for Fresno
It was quite a scenic drive
Pulled over to watch the children in the park
We  used to only worry for them after dark

[Chorus]
I’m  still looking for my own version of America
One without the gun, where the flag can freely fly
No  bombs in the sky, only fireworks when you and I collide
It's just a dream I had in mind
It's just a dream I had in mind
It’s just a dream I had in mind

[Verse 2]
I  flew back to New York City
Missed that Hudson River line
Took a train up to Lake Placid
That's another place and time, where
I used to go to drive-ins and listen to the blues
So many things that I think twice about before I do now

[Chorus]
I'm still looking for my own version of America
One without the gun, where the flag can freely fly
No bombs in the sky, only fireworks when you and I collide
It's just a dream I had in mind
It's just a dream I had in mind
It's just a dream I had in mind
It's just a dream I had in mind


Title: Lost at Sea

Lyrics:
[Verse: Lana Del Rey]
Once you told me
Look for the north star, then you'll see
Heavenly, I hear
Found my way to the beach
And there were waves over me
I was lost at sea
'Til you found me, 'til you found me
Ha-ha-ha-ha, happily
Happily, happily
I was found lost at sea
Ah, ah
Mm, oh
Lost at sea

[Outro: Lana Del Rey]
Happily, happily
I was found lost at sea
Ah, ah
Mm
Lost at sea


Title: Love

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Look at you kids with your vintage music
Coming through satellites while we're cruising
You're part of the past
But now you're the future
Signal's crossing
Can get confusing

[Pre-Chorus]
It's enough just to make you feel crazy
Crazy, crazy, sometimes
It's enough just to make you feel crazy

[Chorus]
You get ready
You get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
Back to work, or the coffee shop
Doesn't matter
'Cause it's enough to be young and in love
To be young and in love

[Verse 2]
Look at you kids
You know you're the coolest
The world is yours and you can't refuse it
Seen so much, you could get the blues
But that don't mean that you should abuse it

[Pre-Chorus]
It's enough just to make you feel crazy
Crazy, crazy, I know
It's enough just to make you feel crazy

[Chorus]
You get ready
You get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
Back to work, or the coffee shop
It don't matter
Because it's enough to be young and in love
To be young and in love

[Bridge]
Don't worry, baby
Don't worry, baby

[Chorus]
I get ready
I get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
Doesn't matter if I'm not enough
For the future or the things to come
'Cause I'm young and in love
I'm young and in love


Title: Loved You Then And Now

Lyrics:
[Unreleased]


Title: Love in Cars

Lyrics:
Note: The following are the lyrics of the original song
Lana's version might differ (if it ever resurfaces)

[Verse 1]
I can't hide the hole inside
Promised me that you would always be
Pierced my heart with cupids dart
The pressure builds and I can't sit still
Your mama doesn't wanna let you go
For a drive in my sky blue eldorado

[Chorus]
There's love in the back of my dads cadillac
There's love in the back of his new cadillac
There's love in the back of my dads cadillac
Thеre's love in the back of his nеw cadillac

[Verse 2]
All night long we watch the windows fog
And I can see my destiny
The music flows from the am radio
I'm almost sure that I'm gonna score
Pull you close and ask you what's the wait
Lets seize the opportunity before it's too late

[Chorus]
There's love in the back of my dads cadillac
There's love in the back of his new cadillac
Yes there's love and I should be thanking someone

[Bridge]
What are you waiting for?
There's no better time than right now
What are we waiting for?
No better time to explore

[Chorus]
There's love in the back of my dads cadillac
There's love in the back of his new cadillac
There's love in the back of my dads cadillac
There's love in the back of his new cadillac
Yes there's love and I should be thanking someone


Title: Lover’s Fate

Lyrics:
[Intro]
Delicate and fragile, he was charming I was agile
And I don't want him back, but I do
So easily broken, this thing that we built
Baby, I wasn't meant to go through this with you

[Verse]
And I don't understand
How we have done all we could do with this more than we can
And I don't understand
Two different people can live inside of one man

[Chorus]
There is a dark part of us
A place that collects all the dust
A door to a room we keep
Locked up tight, tight, tight

And there is a switch on the wall
Controls the lamp in the hall
I think that we turn on the light, light, light

[Post-Chorus]
And unlock the door (And unlock the door)
To let ourselves in
But now I am glued to the floor
I am alone and the air I'm breathing is getting thin

[Bridge]
Delicate and fragile, he was charming I was agile
And I don't want him back, but I do
So easily broken, this thing that we built
Baby, I wasn't meant to go through this with you

And how does this love translate?
How does this love translate?
How does this love translate
Into this lover's fate?
(Mm, mm, mm)
Lover's fate?
(Mm, mm, mm)

[Chorus]
There is a dark part of us
A place that collects all the dust
A door to a room we keep
Locked up tight, tight, tight

And there is a switch on the wall
Controls the lamp in the hall
I think that we turn on the light, light, light

[Post-Chorus]
And unlock the door (And unlock the door)
To let ourselves in
But now I am glued to the floor
I am alone and I am getting thin

[Outro]
Delicate and fragile, he was charming I was agile
And I don't want him back, but I do

How does this love translate?
How does this love translate?
How does this love translate
Into this lover's fate?

Lover's fate
Lover's fate
Lover's fate

Delicate and fragile, he was charming I was agile
And I don't want him back, but I do


Title: Love song

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
In the car, in the car, in the backseat, I'm your baby
We go fast, we go so fast, we don’t move
I believe in a place you take me
Make you real proud of your baby
In your car, I'm a star and I'm burnin’ through you
In your car, I'm a star and I'm burnin' through you

[Chorus]
Oh, be my once in a lifetime
Lyin' on your chest in my party dress
I'm a fuckin' mess, but I
Oh, thanks for the high life
Baby, it's the best, passed the test and yes
Now I’m here with you, and I
Would like to think that you would stick around
You know that I’d just die to make you proud
The taste, the touch, the way we love
It all comes down to make the sound of our love song

[Verse 2]
Dream a dream, here's a scene
Touch me anywhere ’cause I'm your baby
Grab my waist, don't waste any part
I believe that you see me for who I am
So spill my clothes on the floor of your new car
Is it safe, is it safe to just be who we are?
Is it safe, is it safe to just be who we are?

[Chorus]
Oh, be my once in a lifetime
Lyin' on your chest in my party dress
I’m a fuckin' mess, but I
Oh, thanks for the high life
Baby, it's the best, passed the test and yes
Now I'm here with you, and I
Would like to think that you would stick around
You know that I'd just die to make you proud
The taste, the touch, the way we love
It all comes down to make the sound of our love song
The taste, the touch, the way we love
It all comes down to make the sound of our love song


Title: Lucky Ones

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Let's get out of this town, baby, we're on fire
Everyone around here seems to be going down, down, down
If you stick with me, I can take you higher and higher
It feels like all of our friends are lost, nobody's found, found, found

[Pre-Chorus]
I got so scared, I thought no one could save me
You came along, scooped me up like a baby

[Chorus]
Every now and then, the stars align
Boy and girl meet by the great design
Could it be that you and me are the lucky ones?
Everybody told me love was blind
Then I saw your face and you blew my mind
Finally, you and me are the lucky ones this time

[Verse 2]
Boy, get into my car, got a bad desire
You know that we'll never leave if we don't get out now, now, now
You're a careless con and you're a crazy liar, but baby
Nobody can compare to the way you get down, down, down

[Pre-Chorus]
I tried so hard to act nice like a lady
You taught me that it was good to be crazy

[Chorus]
Every now and then, the stars align
Boy and girl meet by the great design
Could it be that you and me are the lucky ones?
Everybody told me love was blind
Then I saw your face and you blew my mind
Finally, you and me are the lucky ones this time

[Bridge]
Feels like, feels like, you know it feels like
Falling in love for the first time
Feels like, you know it feels like
Falling in love

[Chorus]
Every now and then, the stars align
Boy and girl meet by the great design
Could it be that you and me are the lucky ones?
Everybody told me love was blind
Then I saw your face and you blew my mind
Finally, you and me are the lucky ones this time

Climb up the H of the Hollywood sign (Yeah)
In these stolen moments, the world is mine

Too much fun tonight, yeah

We're the captains of our own souls
So there's no need for us to hesitate
We're all alone, let's take control
And I was like

Take off, take off, take off all your clothes
Take off, take off, take off all your clothes
Take off, take off, take off all of your clothes

There's no stopping now, green lights forever
And I was like

Take off, take off, take off all your clothes
Take off, take off, take off all your clothes
Take off, take off, take off all of your clothes

Title: Lust For Life [Album Trailer]

Lyrics:
You know, in this town an artist really needs a lot of space when they're trying to create something special. A place to cultivate a world of their own, far away from the real world that's around them.

Luckily for me, I live right inside the middle of the 'H' of the Hollywood sign, and this is how I spent most of my nights: perched high above the chaos that swirls within the City of Angels below. Now don't get me wrong, I love to dip my toe into the muck and the mires of the city every now and then, especially on Tuesdays. But truthfully, when I'm in the middle of making a record - especially now, when the world is in the middle of such a tumultuous period - I find I really need to take the space for myself, far away from real life to consider what my contribution to the world should be in these dark times.

So each morning I have the luxury of asking myself, "What shall I cook up for the kids today? Something with a little spice? Something with a little bitterness but is ultimately sweet? Or shall I take the day off and turn down the fire, and just take a moment to send my love to them over the ether?" Because sometimes just being pure of heart, and having good intentions, and letting them be known is the most worthy contribution an artist can make.

So, even though these times can feel a little bit crazy, they're not so very different from what other generations have experienced at one time or another before. Amidst all the uncertainty, and as we transition out of one era into another one, there's no place I'd rather be than smack-dab in the middle of 'Hollyweird' making this record for you. Because you and the music, and this place are my love, my light, and my lust for life.


Title: Madly

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I was off the coast of Havana Maria
Broke like I always wanted
You were hopped up, getting drunk on sangria
Drunk like you always wanted
Couple crazy kids but by the physical
I think you're crazy, bitch, but purely musical

[Pre-Chorus]
Swim across my blue lake
Come into my boathouse
Eat my birthday cake
Take all your clothes off

[Chorus]
I don't want your cherry
I just want you very badly
I don't wanna marry you, just wanna be your darling
I don't wanna fall in love, just wanna make you happy
Let me love you more, more, more
La, la, la love you madly

[Verse 2]
We can go down, pray to Santa Maria
Fuck what I've wanted and followed
Somewhere far on the road near Virginia
Lifе like I always wanted
Feel like I first did
Wе're fucked on the physical
It's just the way life is
I don't know what I want

[Pre-Chorus]
Swim across my blue lake
Come into my boathouse
Eat my birthday cake
Take all your clothes off

[Chorus]
I don't want your cherry
I just want you very badly
I don't wanna marry you, just wanna be your darling
I don't wanna fall in love, just wanna make you happy
Let me love you more, more, more
La, la, la love you madly

[Outro]
Madly, madly, madly, madly, madly, madly, madly, madly, madly
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah, yeah, yeah
Let me love you madly, madly
Madly, madly, madly, madly, madly, ah
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ah, ah
Madly, madly, ma- madly
Love you madly


Title: Magic Tree and I Let Myself Go

Lyrics:
[Verse]
The crazy days, city lights
The way you'd play with me like a child

Will you still love me
When I'm no longer
Young and beautiful?
Will you still love me
When I've got nothing
But my achin' soul?
I know you will, I know you will
I know that you will


Title: Maha Maha

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Every time that you walk out on me
I regress back to the one that I can't see
He's someone I have never talked about
'Cause I know that we'd both be dead if you found out

[Verse 2]
Every time you tell me that I'm wrong
I just can't remember how to play along
There's something I have never told you
I'm not really from this world
There's something I have been with holdin'
I'm not like every other girl

[Chorus]
Loha, loha, mahi, mahi, Yoha, yoho
Loha, loha, mahi, mahi, Yoha, yoho
You are the man of my dreams that I've waited for
You are the man of my dreams that I've waited for

[Verse 3]
So if you begin to think
That my light might be supernatural
I'd have to say "You're right, you're right, mon cher, it is"
I come from a place that your mind cannot even imagine
Where we sing "Maha, maha, maha, maha"

[Chorus]
Loha, loha, mahi, mahi, Yoha, yoho
Loha, loha, mahi, mahi, Yoha, yoho
You are the man of my dreams that I've waited for
You are the man of my dreams that I've waited for

[Bridge]
Maha, oh Maha
Oh Maha, Maha
I give my loving, I'm your devoted
I'll give my love, babe
I'm your devoted

[Outro]
Maha, Maha, Maha, Maha
Maha, Maha, Maha


Title: Making Out

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Hiya honey
What ya doin'?
I been hula-hoopin' waiting for you, aah
Whoa haters, fakers, mass-manipulators
Don't know what you're tryin' to prove
I'm the New York City queen queen
You should hear me sing sing
Baby I'm the real thing, check one two
Stop looking at my train-wreck life and start
Listening to the way I sing the blues

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You know, I know what they say about me
I know that they think I'm danger
So what if it makes me happy, happy, happy?

[Chorus]
It doesn't really matter what you say
Cause I ain't gonna quit 'til the day I die
I'll be taking drugs, doing shots, making out in parking lots
With any little boy I spot
Baby you can't stop me, stop me, now
When I'm hot, I'm hot

[Verse 2]
"Hiya honey
How's it goin'?
Saw you skipping up on TV looking blue aah
You're shakin', makin' music and you're famous
Deep down you're the same girl I knew"

[Pre-Chorus 2]
She said, I know what they say about you
I know that they think you're crazy
I know that they are mistaken, baby, baby

[Chorus]
It doesn't really matter what they say
Cause I ain't gonna quit 'til the day I die
I'll be taking drugs, doing shots, making out in parking lots
With any little boy I spot
Baby you can't stop me, stop me, now
When I'm hot, I'm hot

[Bridge]
Singing for the gangsters
Chasin' all that paper
Living life so dangerously
And there's nothing for my anger
Money is my savior
I can be whatever I think
It's like heaven, heaven
Living on the edge never knowing where I'm going to be
And I am dreading, never settling down
That's when dying is beginning to please

[Chorus]
It doesn't really matter what you say
Cause I ain't gonna quit 'til the day I die
I'll be taking drugs, doing shots, making out in parking lots
With any little boy I spot
Honey you can't stop me, stop me, now
When I'm hot, I'm hot


Title: Manicure

Lyrics:
Trying to cut the feeling with my hips
Instead of this i get my nails full of shit


Title: Margaret

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Lana Del Rey]
This is a simple song, gonna write it for a friend
My shirt is inside out, I'm messy with the pen
He met Margaret on a rooftop, she was wearin' white
And he was like, "I might be in trouble"
He had flashes of the good life, he was like
"Should I jump off this building now or do it on the double?"

[Pre-Chorus: Both]
'Cause, baby, if your love is in trouble
Baby, if your love is in trouble
Baby, if your love is in trouble

[Chorus: Both]
When you know, you know
When you know, you know
It kinda makes me laugh
Runnin' down that path
When you're good as gold
'Cause when you know, you know

[Verse 2: Jack Antonoff]
Word to all my friends
With their rеd flags, their white knights
Their black еyes and their blue lies
If you're askin' yourself, "How do you know?"
Then that's your answer, the answer is "No"
You gotta run, gotta run, run, run, run like your head's on fire
Run away like your head is on fire

[Pre-Chorus: Both]
'Cause, baby, if your love is in trouble
Baby, if your love is in trouble
Baby, if your love is in trouble

[Chorus: Both, Lana Del Rey]
When you know, you know
When you know, you know
It kinda makes me laugh
Runnin' down that path
When you're good as gold
'Cause when you know, you know
And when you're old, you're old
Like Hollywood and me
The diamond on your ring
The soul that you bring to the table
The one that makes me sing
In a minor key
'Cause when you know, you know
When you know, you know

[Interlude: Lana Del Rey]
So if you don't know, don't give up
'Cause you never know what the new day might bring

[Bridge: Both, Lana Del Rey]
Maybe tomorrow you'll know
Maybe tomorrow you'll know
Maybe tomorrow you'll know
I mean, join the party
By the way, the party is December 18
(Alright, let's waltz this out, kids)

[Chorus: Both, Lana Del Rey]
'Cause when you know, you know
And when you're old, you're old
Like Hollywood and me
That diamond on your ring
The soul that you bring to the table
The one that makes me sing
In a minor key
Diamond on your ring
'Cause when you know, you know
When you know, you know


Title: Marilyn

Lyrics:
Are you feeling lucky tonight?
Marilyn, Marilyn, Marilyn
Marilyn, Marilyn, Marilyn, Marilyn
Are you wearing nothing tonight, Marilyn?
Marilyn, Marilyn
Marilyn, Marilyn
Marilyn
Are you blessing somebody tonight?
Are you blessing?

Have you ever seen Downtown New Orleans?
That's where I'm from
That's were I've been, where I was made
Somewhere laying in between

Marilyn, Marilyn
Marilyn, Marilyn


Title: Mariners Apartment Complex

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
You took my sadness out of context
At the Mariners Apartment Complex
I ain't no candle in the wind
I'm the board, the lightning, the thunder
Kind of girl who's gonna make you wonder
Who you are and who you've been

[Pre-Chorus]
And who I've been is with you on these beaches
Your Venice bitch, your die-hard, your weakness
Maybe I could save you from your sins
So kiss the sky and whisper to Jesus
My, my, my, you found this, you need this
Take a deep breath, baby, let me in

[Chorus]
You lose your way, just take my hand
You're lost at sea, then I'll command your boat to me again
Don't look too far, right wherе you are, that's where I am
I'm your man
I'm your man

[Verse 2]
Thеy mistook my kindness for weakness
I fucked up, I know that, but Jesus
Can't a girl just do the best she can?
Catch a wave and take in the sweetness
Think about it, the darkness, the deepness
All the things that make me who I am

[Pre-Chorus]
And who I am is a big-time believer
That people can change, but you don't have to leave her
When everyone's talking, you can make a stand
'Cause even in the dark, I feel your resistance
You can see my heart burning in the distance
Baby, baby, baby, I'm your man (Yeah)

[Chorus]
You lose your way, just take my hand
You're lost at sea, then I'll command your boat to me again
Don't look too far, right where you are, that's where I am
I'm your man
I'm your man

[Outro]
Catch a wave and take in the sweetness
Take in the sweetness
You want this, you need this
Are you ready for it?
Are you ready for it?
Are you ready for it?

If they're gonna talk, let 'em

Sweet neighborhood
Love, dreams made of

Sweet neighborhood
Love, dreams made of
It's a match made in heaven
If they're gonna talk, let 'em

I'm not a trick but I'm a trick for you
I'm the girl next door, doin' what you wanna do
What I'll never do, I really fell for you
You give me butterflies, heart skippin' one, two

I, I, I, gotta get it started
I want it bad, bad, I want it bad

I know you're sick, boy, I wanna get the flu
I'm runnin' temperatures thinking of your love, boo
Dizzy spells, ooh, is your love true?
I'm under influence, gettin' hot and chills too

I, I, I, gotta get it started
I want it bad, bad, I want it bad

Uh-oh, uh-oh)
(Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh
Uh-oh, uh-oh)

You're such a bad boy, I heard about you
And so has every other girl, that's why they want you
My local rockstar, the Willie B. crew
You out there on the grind
Now come home to your queen, boo

I, I, I, gotta get it started
I want it bad, bad, I want it bad
You're number one, boy, no one else will do
I'm like a prize fighter, clockin' chicks to get to you
This race I run for you, won't stop until I'm through
I'm out there doing shit that I should never ever do

I, I, I, gotta get it started
I want it bad, bad, I want it bad

(Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh
Uh-oh, uh-oh)

Title: Meet Me in the Pale Moonlight

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Understand this, I'm not looking for true love tonight
If you wanna be my little baby
You can meet me in the pale moonlight
I been workin' every day 8 to 9 and
Serving Coke and fries at the movie blue drive-in
If you want me, you know where to find me

[Chorus]
I can be your one time baby
I can be your little dairy queen
I don't wanna care tonight, I don't wanna fight
You don't have to give me anything
Just put your sweet kiss, kiss on my lips now, baby

[Verse 2]
Understand this, I been likin' you since I was small
I don't wanna get you runnin' scared
When there's no pressure there at all
I been workin' 8 to 9 every day
And think about you almost all the time, all the time and
If I wanna see you, I drive by

[Chorus]
I can be your one time baby
I can be your little dairy queen
I don't wanna care tonight, I don't wanna fight
You don't have to give me anything
Just put your sweet kiss, kiss on my lips now, baby

[Bridge]
I'm the sweetest girl in town so why are you so mean?
When you gonna ditch that stupid **** you got?
It's me you should be seein'

[Verse 3]
Hello-o-o you are lookin' so fine, so fine
Fantasy about you's like a gold mine, gold mine
Askin' everybody, "Is he mine? Is he mine?"
Not quite yet, but I'm gonna get-get him
Not quite yet, but I'm gonna get-get him

[Chorus]
I can be your one time baby
I can be your little dairy queen
I don't wanna care tonight, I don't wanna fight
You don't have to give me anything
Just put your sweet kiss, kiss on my lips now, baby
