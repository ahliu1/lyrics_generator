Title: A Clear Mind, A Better Time

Lyrics:
I was just thinking that while we’re still young
We should go and get married and live in the sun
And keep our parents waiting and waiting for us to come home

I’ll make us coffee to keep us awake
And play you old love songs lost in the hay
And you’ll never, never, never have to be alone

We could lie
And waste your time
I’d make you feel better

Remember the classrooms, the whitewash the slacks
The ceilings that crumbled from flawless to cracked
The children sat quietly learning just how to grow old

Our friends were all brutal, our teachers were brash
But the shit we had to deal with in high school is passed
And as long as you’ll feel it with me then I’ll feel it with you

And if you can’t heal, had the last one steal
Then I’ll show you love
How we used to feel
We felt so much better

You’ll get tattoos of my name on your chest
Cause the things we know now are the things we’ll forget
And some day you’ll wish that you never made commitments like that

And when I grow old and start losing my mind
And tears they fall heavy and hot from your eyes
Just remember the day that I let myself open to you
Just remember the day that I let myself open to you


Title: All We Ever Do Is Talk

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I know you're my person
And I won’t find no one like you
You know I'm your guy
Your best friend, and your lover too
What did we lose?

[Pre-Chorus]
All we ever do is talk
Man I'm so exhausted
Circles till we’re nauseous
What happened

[Chorus]
To meeting you at the hotel, 3AM
Pull the belt from your robe, pushing me on the bed
It was good, it was good, didn't know what it meant
Will we ever get that feeling again?
With your back on the wall, pulling off my suit
You could hear us from the hallway, flipping the room
It was good, it was good, didn't want it to end
Will we ever get that feeling again?

[Verse 2]
Coming back to cеnter
After we dissеct the roots (yeah)
Oh, fall asleep on my shoulder
Breathe out when I hold you
Wake up, do it over again and again and again
What happened

[Chorus]
To meeting you at the hotel, 3AM
Pull the belt from your robe, pushing me on the bed
It was good, it was good, didn't know what it meant
Will we ever get that feeling again?
With your back on the wall, pulling off my suit
You could hear us from the hallway, flipping the room
It was good, it was good, didn't want it to end
Will we ever get that feeling again?

[Bridge]
Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh
It was good
It was good
It was good
It was good
It was good
It was good
Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh
It was good
It was good
It was good
We were good
It was good, good, good, good, good

[Pre-Chorus]
All we ever do is talk
Man I'm so exhausted
Circles till we're nauseous
What happened

[Chorus]
To meeting you at the hotel, 3AM
Pull the belt from your robe, pushing me on the bed
It was good, it was good, didn't know what it meant
Will we ever get that feeling again?
With your back on the wall, pulling off my suit
You could hear us from the hallway, flipping the room
It was good, it was good, didn’t want it to end
Will we ever get that feeling again?

[Outro]
Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh
It was good
It was good
It was good
It was good
It was good
It was good
Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh
It was good
It was good
It was good
We were good
It was good, good, good, good, good


Title: Alone Together

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I don’t ever tell you nothing, no
I don’t have the courage, do you mind it?
I’ve been superstitious at night now, I’ve been
More specifically I’m frightened

[Pre-Chorus]
“Don’t die,” I said, “I won’t,” you repeat
I’m so in my head, my thumb’s on your teeth
I’m coasting through life, you sold your twenties
Tell me, how did it happen?

[Chorus]
Oh love, oh my my
Don’t you find it moving how we’re still alone
Still alone together
Oh love, oh my my
Don’t you find it moving how we’re still alone
Still alone together

[Post-Chorus]
Tell me what would you do for love
Now that you found it

[Verse 2]
Smoking, hanging off of my hand and coughing
“Do you wanna move in with me?”
You can do the crossword while I’m making breakfast
Don’t tell me if you have to cheat

[Pre-Chorus]
I’ll try my best to keep you appeased
You’re crying on my chest, I’m high on my knees
I’m so sad but I
Just don’t make me leave
Fuck, how did this happen?

[Chorus]
Oh love, oh my my
Don’t you find it moving how we’re still alone
Still alone together
Oh love, oh my my
Don’t you find it moving how we’re still alone
Still alone together

[Post-Chorus]
Tell me what would you do for love
Now that you found it
Yeah tell me what would you do for love
Now that you found it
Tell me what would you do

[Outro]
Don’t you find it moving
Oh, don’t you find it moving
Oh, don’t you find it moving how we’re still alone


Title: Anywhere With You

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Walked in straight away and slammed the door last night
I caught you on the couch, you were having a fright all alone
With the TV on
Clothes strewn on the floor, I got down on my knees
You told me everything that you wanted to be all along
Was it wrong?

[Chorus]
And I said, "Listen, oh, I know it's been a long, long year
But I think we should go and get you out of here"
I'll go anywhere, anywhere with you
Pack up all your shit and put it in the back
Maybe the miles can make up for the things you lack
I'll go anywhere, anywhere with you

[Verse 2]
Cruising 95 like we got nothing to lose
I'm praying to the headlights like I prayеd to you
Before I found you
Roll the windows down, kill thе radio
I'd rather hear the wind than hear that song I'm supposed to know
By some fucking bro'

[Chorus]
You tell me that forever couldn't come too soon
I wanna lose my mind in a hotel room with you
Anywhere would do
I'm sittin' in the bath like it's pouring rain
You call me from the hall just to say my, say my name
I'll go anywhere with you
I'll go anywhere with you
Anywhere with you
Anywhere with you
I'll go anywhere with you

[Bridge]
Would you tell me if I ever started holding you back?
Would you talk me off the guard rail of my panic attack?
Look me straight in my center and tell me from the heart
Are you ready to start? Are you ready to start?
Are you ready to start? Are you ready to start?
Are you ready to start?

[Chorus]
You tell me that forever couldn't come too soon
If I'm gonna lose my mind, I'm gonna lose it with you
You tell me you want everything, you want it fast
But all I've ever wanted is to make something fucking last
I'll go anywhere, I'll go anywhere, I'll go anywhere with you
Anywhere with you
Anywhere with you
Anywhere with you


Title: Beach House

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
In a k-hole listening to Beach House
Light my cigarette for me while I bleed out
I'm a cataract on the heal
Ideatin' in the rain through the comedown
She yelled her ex's name when she came
How the hell am I supposed to feel?

[Pre-Chorus]
And isn't it so sad?
Isn't it so sad I'll never be that?
And isn't it so sad I'll never be?

[Chorus]
All I need is a place to go
Her sweat, cigarette, till I'm back in the madness
Let me leave, I don't wanna know
Her sweat, sunset, for a taste of the habit

[Post-Chorus]
And there's no way out, there's no way out
Don't bite the hand, don't let me drown
In her sweat, cigarette, till I'm back in the madness

[Verse 2]
In a k-hole listening to Nick Cave
I cut my tongue sucking on a toothache
Red wine and a plate of veal
In a blind rage feelin' like a Boy Scout
I sold myself heavy I'm a whore now
A coward with a face of tears

[Pre-Chorus]
And isn't it so sad?
Isn't it so sad I'll never be that?
And isn't it so sad I'll never be?

[Chorus]
All I need is a place to go
Her sweat, cigarette, till I'm back in the madness
Let me leave, I don't wanna know
Her sweat, sunset, for a taste of the habit

[Post-Chorus]
And there's no way out, there's no way out
Don't bite the hand, don't let me drown
In her sweat, cigarette, till I'm back in the madness

[Bridge]
The hotel room where I camped out
Blurry tattoos, the highway sounds
Run with no shoes, I cave in now, I cave in now

[Chorus]
All I need is a place to go
Her sweat, cigarette, till I'm back in the madness
Let me leave, I don't wanna know
Her sweat, sunset, for a taste of the habit

[Post-Chorus]
And there's no way out, there's no way out
Don't bite the hand, don't let me drown
In her sweat, cigarette, till I'm back in the madness


Title: Be My Own (Bonus Track)

Lyrics:
We never sleep at night
But we’ll spend the days in bed
And you walk down the stairs ever so gingerly
Could’ve lived but I chose to love you instead

Fix me your poison, gin for your molly
Lime for your bruises and chalk for your holly
Tell me you’re sleeping
I can’t if you won’t
Yeah you could be my own

The way that you smile when something pleasant is up in your mind
And you put your tiny lips to my ear
We could break this old routine, this apartment you and me
We could leave this town my dear

Rats in your armchair, burrs in your cotton
Baby turn my engines from polished to rotten
Promise you’ll keep me in a box by the phone
Yeah you could be my own

Would you burn all the crows in my fields?
Sing me to sleep
You won’t ever have to walk, cause my cars just down the block
And Japan’s only two weeks away if you travel by sea

Love where you moving? Heart where you going?
Your clothes on the floor, yeah your bruises are showing
Airplanes can take you to Paris or Rome
But you’ll still be my own

Bells in the boathouse, champagne and icing
It’s just like the movies, yeah your parents are crying
Our family’s all gathered but we’re getting stoned
Yeah you could be my own
I left all her pictures in a box by the road
So you could be my own


Title: Better Than I Know Myself

Lyrics:
[Intro]
(Don't you know me–)

[Verse 1]
I can't read you like a magazine
Can't even see you right in front of me talking
Your lips are moving, I don't hear a thing
No, you're not getting through to me
And I know you'd rather–

[Pre-Chorus]
Turn the other cheek
But you hit me up a thousand times a week
Scared to tell you that I don't want you to leave
'Cause I know you could
Yeah, I know you could

[Chorus]
This can't be right
I'm scared, and I need someone to call me
I'll close my eyes 'til you arrive
And take me how you want me
Don't you know me better than I know me?
Don't you know me better than I know mysеlf?

[Verse 2]
I can't even hold a flame to it
Struggling to find a namе to call it
Wonder if I'm being obvious
Maybe I'm acting out a wish
That you'd never go and

[Pre-Chorus]
Turn the other cheek
You used to hit me up a thousand times a week
Scared to tell you that I don't want you to leave
'Cause I know you could
Yeah, oh, I know you could

[Chorus]
This can't be right
I'm scared, and I need someone to call me
I'll close my eyes 'til you arrive
And take me how you want me
Don't you know me better than I know me?
Don't you know me better than I know myself?

[Post-Chorus]
(Don't you know me–)

[Chorus]
This can't be right
I'm scared, and I need someone to call me
I'll close my eyes 'til you arrive
And take me how you want me
Don't you know me better than I know me?
Don't you know me better than I know myself?

[Outro]
(Don't you know me–)
Better than I know myself, better than I know myself
(Don't you know me–)
Better than I know myself, better than I know myself
(Don't you know me–)


Title: Bug Bites

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
We could share a life if we wanted to
This could be the loneliest lesson
We could both be fine if you left us to it
Shame we both get so high and testin' it

[Chorus]
And when you know I've been sleeping out
Makes you wanna hit me
Makes you wanna kiss me, too
I've been sleepin' out
Don't you wanna hit me?
Every single bug bite on your wrist
Visible reminders, you've become an island just like me
Right now, you're just like me
Just like me
Visible reminders, you've become an island just like me

[Verse 2]
Talking to yourself when you've been drinking late
Hear you dropping glasses in the kitchen
Curse the way we muscle out
It keeps us aching
Hopelessly addicted to the friction

[Chorus]
And when you know I've been sleeping out
Makes you wanna hit me
Makes you wanna kiss me, too
I've been sleepin' out
Don't you wanna hit me?
Every single bug bite on your wrist
Visible reminders, you've become an island just like me
Right now, you're just like me
Just like me
Visible reminders, you've become an island just like me
Just like me, just like me
Visible reminders, you've become an island just like me

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, love, tell me we're not tragic
I can't let you go but I can't really have you
Oh, love, tell me we're not tragic
I can't let you go but I can't really have you

[Chorus]
And when you know I've been sleeping out
Makes you wanna hit me
Makes you wanna kiss me, too
I've been sleepin' out
Don't you wanna hit me?
Every single bug bite on your wrist
Visible reminders, you've become an island just like me
Right now, you're just like me
Just like me
Visible reminders, you've become an island just like me
Just like me, just like me
Visible reminders, you've become an island just like me

[Outro]
Just like me, just like me
Visible reminders, you've become an island just like me


Title: Chastain

Lyrics:
Man, I just wanna live a day as a blonde
I'll look like Jessica Chastain
Get mistaken for a man with a job
Taking sessions on my lunch break

You won't believe what an apartment would cost
When living right by the freeway
Watching TV in my dollar store socks
I don't get out much these days

Convince myself that I've been talking too much
Picture hours of replay
It's pretty lonely just writing a song
When you know your friends are all moving away

And I just wanna see a picture of mom
From when she was my age
Was she hard to get as everyone thought?
Was she happier in those days?

Sleeping, getting payed
Subway's running late
Leaving the rest up to question just to find that you wouldn't got it made
Weather ain't been bad
Floss and take a bath
Leave all the rest up to question just to find you hardly ever left

Man, I just wanna be the type to forget
Oh, the embarrassing montage
Seeing pictures from when I was a kid
Down at the beach with my brother

And I don't wanna be a ghost when I'm dead
I think I'm tired of jump scares
Sitting quiet at the foot of your bed
Watch you crying from the top of the stairs

Work out, pay the rent
Thinking about your ex
Leaving the rest up to question just to find that you got nothing left
Fall back out of love
Take too many drugs
Leave all the rest up to question just to find that you ain't young enough

And when I'm feeling sad
Just remember that
I've got songs to hide behind until the feelings pass
It ain't much of a life
But maybe once or twice
I've felt magic touching pen to paper in my time


Title: Cigarettes & Wine

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Del Water Gap]
I want a photo of you in my bed
To carry with me when I go out West
I think I'll put you in another song
A little glimpse of you before you're gone
We could push it for another day
I don't care what other people say
I'll show you off on the Atlantic Coast
The kinda feeling that I want the most

[Pre-Chorus: Del Water Gap]
Face it, we're foolish
But I wouldn't change how we do it

[Chorus: Del Water Gap]
Let's keep living on cigarettes and wine
Shut the curtains to keep the world inside
No, it don't make a difference
Who cares what we're missing?
Let's keep living how we're living

[Verse 2: Holly Humberstone]
I got a picturе of you on my phone
I took it when you drove mе home
Mm, you were a vision in the rose gold light
How come you never even have to try? (Oh)
So, can we push it for another day?
There's nothing here for me (Oh) without you
It soaks me like the English rain
That kinda feeling I could never shake

[Pre-Chorus: Both]
Face it, we're foolish
But I wouldn't change how we do it

[Chorus: Both]
Let's keep living on cigarettes and wine
Shut the curtains to keep the world inside
No, it don't make a difference
Who cares what we're missing?
Let's keep living how we're living

[Bridge: Holly Humberstone, Both]
Face it, we're foolish
But I wouldn't change how we do it
Face it, we're foolish
But I wouldn't change how we do it

[Chorus: Holly Humberstone, Both, Del Water Gap]
Let's keep living on cigarettes and wine
Shut the curtains to keep the world inside
No, it don't make a difference
Who cares what we're missing?
Let's keep living how we're living (Oh)
Let's keep living how we're living (Oh)
Let's keep living how we're living


Title: Complicated - Spotify Singles

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Chill out, whatcha yellin' for?
Lay back, it's all been done before
And if you could only let it be, you would see
I like you the way you are
When we're drivin' in your car
And you're talkin' to me one-on-one
But you become

[Pre-Chorus]
Somebody else 'round everyone else
You're watchin' your back like you can't relax
You're tryin' to be cool
You look like a fool to me
Tell me

[Chorus]
Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're
Actin' like you're somebody else, gets me frustrated
Life's like this, you
And you fall, and you crawl, and you break
And you take what you get
And you turn it into honesty
And promise me, I'm never gonna find you fake it
No, no, no

[Verse 2]
You come over unannounced
Dressed up like you're somethin' else
Where you are and where it's at, you see
You're makin' me
Laugh out when you strike your pose
Take off all your preppy clothes
You know, you're not foolin' anyone
When you become

[Pre-Chorus]
Somebody else 'round everyone else
You're watchin' your back like you can't relax
You're tryin' to be cool
You look like a fool to me
Tell me

[Chorus]
Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're
Actin' like you're somebody else, gets me frustrated
Life's like this, you
And you fall, and you crawl, and you break
And you take what you get
And you turn it into honesty
And promise me, I'm never gonna find you fake it
No, no, no
No (No), no
No (No), no
No, no, no, no

[Bridge]
Chill out, whatcha yellin' for?
Lay back, it's all been done before
And if you could only let it be, you will see

[Pre-Chorus]
Somebody else 'round everyone else
You're watchin' your back like you can't relax
You're tryin' to be cool
You look like a fool to me
Tell me

[Chorus]
Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're
Actin' like you're somebody else, gets me frustrated
Life's like this, you
And you fall, and you crawl, and you break

Title: Coping on Unemployment

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Daily, she sends me photos of her
She's only twenty-something
Terrible with her iPhone
Left me another voicemail
Saying, "Sorry I didn't text you"
"I haven't been sleeping well"

[Verse 2]
It's a slow burn
Coping on unemployment
Cracking her fingers often
I ask her what we're doing
She tries to change the subject
Saying, "I'm scared of turning into a parody of myself"

[Chorus]
And it's hard to give yourself over to something
It's hard to give yourself over to something

[Verse 3]
Sunday, she puts on Sky Fеrreira
She finishes hеrself first
She slept in her mascara
And says, "I think your music got worse"
"Since you went fully sober, at least now you won't kill yourself"
(You need to get some help)

[Chorus]
And it's hard to give yourself over to something (Give yourself over, over)
(Give yourself over, over)
It's hard to give yourself over to something (Give yourself over)
When it could all turn into nothing (Give yourself over, over)

[Bridge]
And now I'm afraid to throw you in a different light
I'm waiting on the moment when we get it right
You're sleeping all alone, I'm sitting up at night
I'm so in my head, I'm so in my head
It's hard to give yourself over
(Give yourself over, over)

[Chorus]
And it's hard to give yourself over to something (Give yourself over, over)
(Give yourself over, over)
It's hard to give yourself over to something (Give yourself over)
When it could all turn into nothing (Give yourself over, over)
And now I'm—


Title: Cut the Rope

Lyrics:
How does it feel
When you break a heart
Does it start to peel
In the weaker parts
Does it fall to dust
Or crumble slow
And does it help you, woh oh
When you cut the rope

So take me in
You perfect soul
My heroin of this hallow grove
And would you take my sin
When you’re on the road
And will you treat me like a kid
When you cut the rope

So are you weak
Or are you hardened by pain
Does it stain your hands
Or can you wash it away
And would you ever think
About the love that we knowed
Every day and every night
Before you cut the rope

So how does it feel
When you’re sleeping alone
Are you weak in the head
Or were you left in the road
Oh and how we walked
Oh and how we’ve grown
Pretty talk to me, woh oh
As I cut the rope

Oh and how we walked
Oh and where have you gone
Pretty talk to me, as I cut the rope


Title: Deirdre, Pt. 1

Lyrics:
I once met a girl at a bar I know
She drank herself to sleep in her dinner coat
It was a quarter past noon

She whispered me a welcome form her lips and lungs
But really she was speaking from the wine she'd drunk
Yeah, she said "It's nice to meet ya

You treat me so
Gentleman
Won't you take me home
And back to bed
Or is it only that I'm dreaming?"

I took ten steps and the she yelled at me:
"I have for you a letter, won't you come to me?"
She signed it "Deirdre."

I'm sorry for your time and this is out of line
But wear it on my sleeve and if you wouldn't mind
I won't leave without ya

So let me take your hand
To the west coast
Let me take your hand
To see my room, or are you not the type for leaving?

Yeah, I've come around far, you know I made it East
My friends, they all settled down so pleasantly
But I was swimming(?)

Life was pretty wild in that New York summer
I bought myself a car, it was a decent one
Then I drove to Austin

To find my love
Had up and gone
To find my love
With another one
Or is it only that I'm dreaming?


Title: Distance

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
It's just an ordinary bias
I watch it unfold from the back
Evan is walking the horizon
He slips on by, we stifle laughs
I wonder why you've not the courage
Haven't you conquered half the land?
Defer the healers when you're hurting
Cast off the one you call your man again, again, and over again

[Chorus]
It gets harder and harder and harder to just breathe
It's harder and harder and harder to be me
When I find myself squared up in your vision, your vision
Oh, it's harder and harder and harder to just breathe
It's hardеr and harder and harder to be mе
When I find that we're closing up the distance between us
The distance between us

[Verse 2]
You call it merely your attraction
I beg to differ if I may
Let's keep it hidden, all these feelings
I wouldn't have it any other way
So don't start talking around

[Chorus]
It gets harder and harder and harder to just breathe
It's harder and harder and harder to be me
When I find myself squared up in your vision, your vision
Oh, it's harder and harder and harder to just breathe
It's harder and harder and harder to be me
When I find that we're closing up the distance between us
The distance between us

[Chorus]
It gets harder and harder and harder to just breathe
It's harder and harder and harder to be me
When I find myself squared up in your vision, your vision
Oh, it's harder and harder and harder to just breathe
It's harder and harder and harder to be me
When I find that we're closing up the distance between us


Title: (Does It Feel Slow?)

Lyrics:
[Interlude: Del Water Gap & Maggie Rogers]
You'll smoke—can we start over?
Need to hit those low notes (Did I do it like two beats higher?)
(Or two beats faster?) Dar-ling
Does it feel slow? (I can't tell)
I like it, I think it's fine (Alright, let's do it)


Title: Doll House

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
"I need somebody tonight"
You told me, talkin' on the ride home
"I need the love of my life
Not just somebody to climb on"

[Pre-Chorus]
And you say, "I realize
Maybe I minimize instead of feelin' it out"
You say you're losin' your mind
But I'll hold the line while you figure it out

[Chorus]
As if you needed a reason
As if you needed a light on
As if you needed the freedom
Of someone you could rely on
If you just needed a break
From the pain and the color of your walls
As if you needed a reason to call me
A reason to call me at all
A reason to call me at all

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
They'll tell you, "Think small, hit the wall, don't you leave the doll house
Blow it up just because you can take the fallout
It never happens at the right time"
Yeah, that's what they say

[Pre-Chorus]
It's hard enough to be human
And worse when you're on your own

[Chorus]
As if you needed a reason
As if you needed a light on
As if you needed the freedom
Of someone you could rely on
If you just needed a break
From the pain and the color of your walls
As if you needed a reason to call me
A reason to call me at all
A reason to call me at all

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Outro]
They'll tell you, "Think small, hit the wall, don't you leave the doll house"
"Blow it up just because you can take the fallout
It never happens at the right time"
Yeah, that's what they say


Title: Don’t Let Me

Lyrics:
Lord don't let me wake at night
Picturing the hands that might be holding her
Though we're far past burned
I left her for to grow up in
The burned out hole, the skeleton of our parents debt
That this city kept

But please don't let me think of that, please don't let me think of it

I've wrote songs for skinny girls
Who could bare to let me hurl my soul to them
And stick to plans
You start with one and end with three
It's all for fun until it's bad to me and I lose my grip
And I fall in it

But please don't let me think of that, please don't let me think of it
Please don't let me think of that, please don't let me think of it

Carola told me on Lexington
Baby when you're older you can have me then
I'll still want your love when you lose your touch
Smoking reds I had her on my back
I think of then and I imagine that I should've kissed
Those famous hips

I'd scream promise me this ain't all for dead
Did I waste your time pulling thread by thread?
That stuff is cash and you lose it fast

But please don't let me think of that, please don't let me think of it
Please don't let me think of that, please don't let me think of it
Please don't let me think of that, please don't let me think of it


Title: Don’t Read the Mirror

Lyrics:
Sophie was a tall girl, held me from across the room
I asked her what's her name, she told me "What's the difference to you?"
Sophie choked me up looking over top of her magazines
And man do we have fun, but man, well she can speak pretty mean

And it hurts, yeah it hurts
Yeah it hurts to admit
That I wish I'd search through the phonebooks again
Yeah, I hate to be alone
I feel like driving blind at the wheel

Baby thinks I need someone
I said, baby thinks I need someone
Do I need someone? Do I need someone?
Yeah, baby says to search for something

Oh, she was a tall girl, looking over shoulders at me
When she finally cracked a smile, I was already flying back in the seat

And it hurts, yeah it hurts
Yeah, it hurts me to say
That I wish she (?) when she told me to stay
But enough just ain't enough when too much is worse than waiting for you

Baby thinks I need someone
I said, baby thinks I need someone
Do I need someone? Do I need someone?
Yeah, baby says to search for something

She was only one of three, but I forgot the others already
I've been here before, but I always leave
Yeah, I forgot the others already
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah

Baby thinks I need someone
I said, baby thinks I need someone
Do I need someone? Do I need someone?
Yeah, baby says to search for something

Baby thinks I need someone
I said, baby thinks I need someone
Do I need someone? Do I need someone?
Yeah, baby says to search for something


Title: Don’t Say Nothing

Lyrics:
When you’re tired I’ll take it slow till you fall into place
And I start pulling at your clothes, the look upon your face leaves me wasted
You lift up your hips for me to help me take it off
And would you fake it to be good to me, cause I’ve been proven wrong
But you’re shaking, yeah you’re shaking and making noise

Don’t say nothing, cause I love you when you don’t know what to say
It helps me make you something that I wouldn’t ever have to change

You turn twenty-one tomorrow, go cut up your fake
Yeah you tell me you like older men, well I’m twenty-four in may
And in the quarter-century I’ve lived, I only bought a double bed to sleep with you

Sitting here in old New York, I picture you in love
With some honey-boy you met him back at home when you were younger
And you adore the way he moves, just like I adore you

Please say something, cause I’ve been growing lonesomer each day
And I need your questions to even feel a little bit okay

Tell me how you slept last night, did you wake in a daze
Of memories from ‘fore you knew my name?
And tell me what can make you cry, did you eat enough today?
Cause you’re looking awful skinny in the face

Don’t say nothing, cause I love you when you don’t know what to say
It helps me make you something that I wouldn’t ever have to change

Don’t say nothing, cause I love you but you gotta act your age
To help me make you something that I wouldn’t ever have to change

To help me make you something that I wouldn’t ever have to change
To help me make you something that I wouldn’t ever have to change


Title: Easy

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I remember sneaking out
Porch steps creaking now
Hoping that we weren't too loud
I remember thinking that
If we keep on drinking
We'll be warm when the sun goes down

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And would you mind sleeping in the car?
'Cause we left the lights on, killed the battery
And it won't start
Could we make the most of the dark?
'Cause I left the lights on, killed the battery

[Chorus]
When you watch me like that
You watch me like that
You watch me
When you watch me like that
I forget I've been lonely
Do you want me like that?
You want me like that
You want me
'Cause I want you like that
So could we let it be easy?

[Verse 2]
We could go swimming now
Smoking, get some in'n'out
Do you ever miss being ten years old?
'Cause this is kinda feeling like
Cheating on your bedtime
These days no one's waiting up at home

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Would you mind sleeping under stars?
'Cause I couldn't stand it
If we missed our chance to take it too far
Could we make the most of the dark?
'Cause I couldn't stand it
Knowing that we never took it too far

[Chorus]
When you watch me like that
You watch me like that
You watch me
When you watch me like that
I forget I've been lonely
Do you want me like that?
You want me like that
You want me
'Cause I want you like that
So could we let it be easy?

[Bridge]
Lean back
Are you falling asleep?
Head lights catching
The whites of your eyes and you're looking at me

[Chorus]
When you watch me like that
You watch me like that
You watch me
When you watch me like that
I forget I've been lonely
Do you want me like that?
You want me like that
You want me
'Cause I want you like that
So could we let it be easy?

Lyrics:

Your pictures off my wall but you still find a way to
Keep haunting me (Haunting me)

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I'm sorry that it has to be like this

Maybe I blame you 'cause it's all my fault
(I'm sorry but I have to hate you)

I don't like the person that you turn me into

Title: Everything I Hate About You*

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I'm sorry but I have to hate you
It hurts me but I know that
There's just no other way
'Cause I'm worried if I let you in
Then the scars will open up like
The skies before the rain
Hmmm

Yeah, I'm sorry
That it has to be like this

For all of my flaws

'Cause it's all my fault


Title: Gemini

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
So here's the setting, we met fucked up at a wedding
Shoulders back, throwing her hair, yeah
She said, "It hasn't been pretty, stuck in a walk-up in Philly
Ain't exactly feel like Paris, yeah"

[Pre-Chorus]
And she don't understand I get so distant
And it ain't any comfort to know that she's sufferin' too
And nothing she can write me makes a difference
And it's all in my head but I wanna believe she'll be mine in a year, maybe two

[Chorus]
I'll drop her a line when I'm feelin' like myself again
'Cause lately I ain't in the mood to pretend
Gemini, when I'm feelin' like myself again
Maybe I could be more than just a friend

[Verse 2]
I've been a monster, talks about me to her mother
Shoppin' for Bertoia chairs, yeah
Found an impostor, hair just like me, thought I lost her
Oh, what a nervous affair, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
And nothing she can write me makes a difference
And it's all in my head but I wanna believe she'll be mine in a year, maybe two

[Chorus]
I'll drop her a line when I'm feelin' like myself again
'Cause lately I ain't in the mood to pretend
Gemini, when I'm feelin' like myself again
Maybe I could be more than just a friend

[Bridge]
Gemini, Gemini
When I'm feelin' like myself
Gemini, when I'm feelin' like—

[Chorus]
I'll drop her a line when I'm feelin' like myself again
'Cause lately I ain't in the mood to pretend
Gemini, when I'm feelin' like myself again
Maybe I could be more than just a friend

[Outro]
(Gemini, Gemini, Gemini)
I could be more than just a friend
(Gemini, Gemini, Gemini)
I could be more than just a friend


Title: Glitter & Honey

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
She's on pills smokin’ menthols
Head to toe in YSL on the rooftop
I don't care what we do long as we do not tell
She says, "Honey, play with me, I'm your Ken doll"
Thrown out by the maître d from the restaurant
Could not keep her hands off me on the way to the hotel

[Chorus]
She’s one of those glitter and honey
Type to get stuck to your soul
She's one of those glitter and honey

[Verse 2]
Do you wanna sweat with me to The Beatles?
She dresses like Hermione but evil
Said she knows my music, hates it
I'm sick, wasted, waiting for her ride to come

[Pre-Chorus]
She said, "The city is pain but the night's so gorgeous"
"I'm not vain, just a little bit bored of this"

[Chorus]
She's one of those glitter and honey
Type to get stuck to your soul
She's one of those family money
But she'd never want you to know

[Post-Chorus]
I kinda like it, I kinda like it, I kinda like it, yeah
I kinda like it, I kinda like it, I kinda like it, yeah
She’s one of those glitter and honey

[Bridge]
When I saw that look in your eye I was awful surprised
Was it love or just a romance? We could give it a try, yeah
By the time you were takin’ my hand I was outta my mind
Didn't care where the evening went, we would take our time

[Pre-Chorus]
She said, "The city is pain but the night’s so gorgeous"
"I'm not vain, just a little bit bored of this"

[Chorus]
She's one of those glitter and honey
Type to get stuck to your soul
She's one of those

[Post-Chorus]
I kinda like it, I kinda like it, I kinda like it, yeah
I kinda like it, I kinda like it, I kinda like it, yeah
She’s one of those glitter and honey


Title: Gone In Seconds

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Sleep with the TV on so I'm not alone
Sober and needy in a motel room
Why did she leave me?
What did she mean when she said, "Gotta go?"
Over-caffeinated, chewin' my cheeks
Been oversaturated, manic for weeks
Have I eliminated any chance I had for relief?
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
And isn't it true?
I always reminded you of your mom
And isn't it true?
We don't get to be young for that long

[Chorus]
I never thought that what I had
Could so easily be lost like that
An infinity was gone in seconds
Gone in seconds

[Verse 2]
You were on your own by seventeen
Went through a dozen winters with no heat
It's hard to fathom all the life you gathered before me, yeah
And you can count the rings on the wood
Without cuttin' down the tree
Measurin' the weight of the way you lived
By what you mean to me

[Chorus]
Yeah, I never thought that what I had
Could so easily be lost like that
An infinity was gone in seconds
Gone in seconds
Yeah, I never thought that what I had
Could so easily be lost like that
An infinity was gone in seconds
Gone in seconds

[Bridge]
Sittin' in your living room, playin' cards
Queen of hearts
There's nothing I would rather do
Than be with you forever
But I know I'll be losin' you to the dark
'Cause nothing lasts forever

[Chorus]
Yeah, I never thought that what I had
Could so easily be lost like that
Gone in seconds
Gone in seconds
Yeah, I never thought that what I had
Could so easily be lost like that
An infinity was gone in seconds
Gone in seconds


Title: High Tops

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Don't you know that you're the only queen
Of this one-horse town?
You're the only one that meant a thing to me
You're still hanging around
You're still hanging around

[Chorus]
I used to see you on the side walk
Standing in your high tops
Ruining your pretty lungs
With your cigarette smoke
It ain't keeping you young

Touch me like you know me
Baby when you're lonely
Kiss me on my open mouth
I'll throw you a rope
I'll keep pulling you out

[Bridge]
Hey, Celine
I open up my heart
It's all for you
You can take or leave me any way you choose

[Verse 2]
All the years that came and went for you
Are you feeling it now?
All the pretty things I tried to say to you
But when I opened my mouth
Nothing came out

[Chorus]
I used to see you on the side walk
Standing in your high tops
Ruining your pretty lungs
With your cigarette smoke
It ain't keeping you young

Touch me like you know me
Baby when you're lonely
Kiss me on my open mouth
I'll throw you a rope
I'll keep pulling you out

[Bridge] x2
Hey, Celine
I open up my heart
It's all for you
You can take or leave me any way you choose

[Chorus]
I used to see you on the side walk
Standing in your high tops
Ruining your pretty lungs
With your cigarette smoke
It ain't keeping you young

Touch me like you know me
Baby when you're lonely
Kiss me on my open mouth
I'll throw you a rope
I'll keep pulling you out

[Bridge] x3
Hey, Celine
I open up my heart
It's all for you
You can take or leave me any way you choose


Title: Homeless

Lyrics:
You’re in bed but I can’t sleep
The homeless man out on the street is juiced
He’s screaming from the sidewalk cause your windows open
I’m not home with you

I whisper you awake and I’ll make your body shake
Until you’re through
Cause I would walk on broken legs
To town and back to buy your bread for you

And I will wait for you
I won’t leave you blue

And when the bar is closing
Then you start to show the broken side of you
Tears all in your eyes
Oh yeah you’re crying bout the guys that left you bruised

I kiss that look right off your face
But you don’t know I’m in a darker place than you
I put your little feet right on my somewhat bigger feet
And walk the moon

And I will wait for you
Yeah I won't leave you blue

And I will wait for you
Yeah I won't leave you blue
Help you tie your shoes
I’ll take care of you


Title: Hurting Kind

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Is our love the hurting kind?
I fear to say it is, but I’m just guessing
Say you wished I’d move to Spain
Or that one of us would die of hypertension

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, how I missed you
Would you let me know
If you’ve been lonesome too and can I kiss you?
Quick before you go

[Chorus]
We can hold still, if you don’t mind
If we ignore it, we can be fine
If we learn our love is the hurting kind
No, it won’t empower me
'Til it kills us, we can live a lie
If we ignore it, we can be fine
If we learn our love is the hurting kind
I’ll let it devour me

[Verse 2]
Sorry that your blouse is stained
I simply can’t do laundry with your schedule
And I say, “I miss my best friend
But babies need to eat, they beg attention.”

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, how I missed you
Would you let me know
If you’ve been lonesome too and can I kiss you?
Quick before you go

[Chorus]
We can hold still, if you don’t mind
If we ignore it, we can be fine
And if we learn our love is the hurting kind
No, it won’t empower me
'Til it kills us, we can live a lie
If we ignore it, we can be fine
If we learn our love is the hurting kind
I’ll let it devour me
Oh, I’ll let it devour me

[Bridge]
Would you let me know
Is our love the hurting kind?
I fear to say it is

[Chorus]
We can hold still, if you don’t mind
If we ignore it, we can be fine
If we learn our love is the hurting kind
No, it won’t empower me
'Til it kills us, we can live a lie
If we ignore it, we can be fine
If we learn our love is the hurting kind
I’ll let it devour me


Title: I Am Drunk, And She Is Insane

Lyrics:
Well the further I go it’s the older I get
And I find I’m alone when I’m drinking
Yeah it’s hard to get on when you roll cigarettes
From the dreams that you dried up and twisted

Naturally, I’ll find my way back to her
And naturally she’ll say no

Time and again I find liquor and friends
Oh the girls, but the headaches get bigger
Yeah she’ll say she’s in love but what’s it worth when you’re drunk
And she’ll leave for a man who’s much richer

And naturally, I’ll find my way back to her
And naturally she’ll say no
Naturally she'll say no

And I don’t miss that anymore


Title: I Hope You Understand

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I had a dream you killed me
Went after my throat
You cracked a smile and kissed me
And you cut me like a loaf
But lying on the gurney
Bleeding like a pig
I took your hands and worried
How, without me, you'd live

[Chorus]
Even when it’s hurting
I hope you understand what you are to me
I hope you understand what you are to me
I hope
And maybe I deserve it
I hope you understand what you are to me
I hope you understand what you are to me
I, I

[Verse 2]
I wanna take you with me
Airplanе food for two
I'll put you in my suitcase
And come out barely bruisеd
I'm so scared of the distance
I'm scared of how you feel
And you're back in his living room
And I'm holding back tears

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm sucking on a stranger
And I'm picturing you move
You speak to me in languages you learned in boarding school

[Chorus]
Even when you're turning
I hope you understand what you are to me
I hope you understand what you are to me
I hope
And maybe I deserve it
I hope you understand what you are to me
I hope you understand what you are to me
I, I

[Bridge]
I don't wanna move out west
Wait on tables in Van Nuys
Beg my brother for money
And a credit card for the rest
Falling sicker and sicker
At the bar over myself
Sell my life to a label
Getting famous and getting shelved
No, I don't wanna follow
I don't wanna follow

[Chorus]
Even when you're turning
I hope you understand what you are to me
I hope you understand what you are to me
I hope
And maybe I deserve it
I hope you understand what you are to me
I hope you understand what you are to me
I, I


Title: In the Yard

Lyrics:
I met two girls in Boulder, we were standing in the cold
I said, “There’s only room for one of you to live inside my home”
But this, this is not my home

The first one took my mind away, the second took my name, Oh yeah, she writes me lovers every day but I need her all the same
I need her all the same

But you’re my leech
I hope you never leave me
You could live inside my heart, killing people just to eat, you’re mine
And if you ever grow old
I will hold you in my hands and tell you just how beautiful you are

When all the old folks went to bed, the gardener was spent
And the children playing quietly, I lost my only friend
And you held my head

The wind it whipped the trees around, it was snowing in the yard
So you ripped a piece right off your shirt and tied it round my arm
And said, “I’ll keep you warm.”

Yeah you’re my leech
I hope you never leave me
You could live inside my heart, killing people just to eat, you’re mine
And if you ever grow old
I will hold you in my hands and tell you just how beautiful you are

I hope you never leave me
You could live inside my heart, killing people just to eat, you’re mine
And if you ever grow old
I will hold you in these hands and tell you just how beautiful you are


Title: It’s Not Fair !

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I want you to know, I think about it
When I'm up alone, I worry about you
I can hardly walk through East Manhattan still

[Verse 2]
I got caught alone in your apartment
Kept you up 'til one, talking your ear off
You'd long gone to work and I was sleeping off the pills

[Pre-Chorus]
So humbled by it, no use in lying
Wiping the sweat back, spitting and crying

[Chorus]
Just to leave me yelling, "It's not fair"
Just to leave me yelling, "It's not fair"
I just wanted you to know I'm scared
And it leaves me yelling, "It's not fair"
(I just wanted you to know I'm scared)

[Verse 3]
We laid on the floor in deep New England
Your brother was home, he always lingered
I had pizza breath but you still curled up in my limbs

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you get drunk and email me
Killing me softly
The feeling impales me
You'll always haunt me
I'm sorry I blame you
That you couldn't keep me still

[Chorus]
Just to leave me yelling, "It's not fair"
Just to leave me yelling, "It's not fair"
I just wanted you to know I'm scared
And it leaves me yelling, "It's not fair"

[Bridge]
Who am I kidding? I can't face you
Let alone my mother asking
"How’d you lose her? Rash behavior?
Twenty-something ever after"
Ever after, keep my distance
Now we're older, still I miss you
Still I sleep late, like we used to
Don't forget me, how I loved you

[Outro]
Just to leave me yelling, "It's not fair"
Just to leave me yelling, "It's not fair"
I just wanted you to know I'm scared
And it leaves me yelling, "It's not fair"
It's not fair


Title: Japanese Posters

Lyrics:
I don’t know what to say
But I know its about you
Don’t look up from the sidewalk
You’ll turn my heart straight to blue

She’s been 21 for six years
I just wanna let you know
She’ll take her coffee with milk and your tears
And then she’ll hit the road

And you’ll find her, sitting in the back of a bar with a cigarette on her lips
Talking to the ex frontman of her favorite band she ain't heard yet
Find her last call at the afterparty
Can you save a dance for me?
Talking to your ex best friend
Like “oh oh oh” take me in

She’s playing with your hair
She pins you to the floor
She’ll walk you up the stairs
Then leave you at the door

Don’t you act surprised
Hers is no disguise
I don’t care who you know or where
Just run your claws through my hair

And you’ll find her, sitting in the back of a bar with a cigarette on her lips
She’s talking to the ex frontman of her favorite band she ain't heard yet
Find her last call at the afterparty
Can you save a dance for me?
Dancing with a blind stuntman
Like “oh oh oh” take me in

You’ll find her, sitting in the back of a bar with a cigarette on her lips
Talking to the ex frontman of her favorite band she ain't heard yet
Find her last call at the afterparty
Can you save a dance for me?
Hows she fooling everyone
She’s just saying “oh oh oh” take me in
Take me in


Title: Laid Down My Arms

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Where you been of lately?
'Cause I’m missing your cheeks
The ones upon your face, babe
And the ones above your knees
You could be a meal now
Leave nothing but your ribs
Or I could settle you a new town
In the mountains where you lived when you were just a kid
And I swear

[Chorus]
I laid down my arms on the day you came along
Yeah, I laid down my arms on the day you came along

[Verse 2]
“How can I be helpful?”
Said the lady on the phone
“Oh, and ain't the weather dreadful? It's all a plan to keep us alone.”
Pinch me, pinch me, pinch me
So that I know I’m awake
And what does “teach your man to fish” mean?
It's to survive another day
I'll hold you if you hold you
Self-respect, I pay it back
And tell your old boy that's the old you
So he don't come around here thinking that he'll get you back
'Cause he won't, though

[Chorus]
I laid down my arms on the day you came along
Yeah, I laid down my arms on the day you came along

[Bridge]
I spent my whole life fighting fear after fear
Yeah, all my days, all my days
I’d do them over and over and over and over again
I’ve been right here before I've made up my mind
Yeah, all my days, all my days
I’d do them over and over and over and over and

[Chorus]
I laid down my arms on the day you came along
Yeah, I laid down my arms on the day you came along

[Outro]
Where you been of lately?
'Cause I'm missing your cheeks


Title: Lamplight

Lyrics:
And lover, where’d you lose your patience
I know you had your patience
I was just a kid

And clueless, you never stop to wonder
If lightning strikes the thunder
Or if it’s just coincidence

Every time your father beat you down
You told him, "Dad it won’t be long,"
And as your tiny body slept that night, I had my lamplight burning strong

And hated
Your bedroom is a dark place, but you've broken all the doorways
And now you're stuck inside

But hopeful
Your memory's still around though, you can see it from your window
As it starts to pass you by

Now I'm in your car, you hold your apples in your arms
You're a friend I used to know, but you still lean against my walls
Tell me beauty I won't bluff, I set my mind to worthless stuff
But I was hoping you'd have the decadence, the appetite of love
But that's alright, yeah that’s alright

Every time your father beat you down
You told him, "Dad it won’t be long,"
And as your tiny body slept that night, I had my lamplight burning strong

And when you came to me, and said, "We gotta leave,"
And so we took your parents' car
And as your tiny body slept that night, I had my lamplight burning strong

And when we got away, but in a couple days
We crashed in Arkansas
And as your tiny body slept that night, I had my lamplight burning strong

And when the cop cars came and took you away
I knew I had to write this song
And as your tiny body slept that night, I had my lamplight burning strong


Title: Let’s Pretend

Lyrics:
You say you work on weekends
At seven in the morning
You fuck me like an old friend
Say your ex was pretty boring, well me too

And you walk me to bodegas
I forgot they're open late night
Maybe someday I could date ya
We'll play dress up and I might need you

And I’ll still pretend
That I’m your man
And you never mind me staying out when you’re at home in bed
Oh and it’s the fool
Who fell for you
No it's not me talking, don’t believe a word he says to you
Oh, let’s pretend
You’ll picture me too

So tell me what you’re into
And I can do ya that way
Throw your back against the window
Leave your clothes on in the hallway, with your shoes

Show me to your best friends
I’ll wear a brand new t-shirt
So better first impression
Is what I’ll leave when it’s all over with you

And I’ll still pretend
That I’m your man
And you never mind me staying out when you’re back home in bed
Oh and it’s the fool
Who fell for you
No, it's not me talking don’t believe a word he says to you
Oh, let’s pretend
You’ll picture me too

Yeah sha la la la oh
Sha la la la oh
Sha la la la oh
Sha la la la oh
Sha la la la oh
Sha la la la aaaaaah

And let’s still pretend
That I’m your man
And you never mind me staying out when you’re back home in bed
Oh and it’s the fool
Who fell for you
No, it's not me talking, don’t believe a single word he says to you
Oh, let’s pretend
You’ll picture me too

Oh, let’s pretend
You’ll picture me too

Oh, let's pretend
You’ll picture me too


Title: ​life sentence

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I, I've been tryin' to get advice
A constant fight to do what's right
Delete your name to break the ties
I wind up turnin' back to you

[Pre-Chorus]
And oh, I'm so, so sorry
But oh, don't know if I can let you go
Let you go, let you go

[Chorus]
'Cause I try, but can't avoid it
Every day I'm disappointed
Don't tell me it's a life sentence
Life sentence
And I'm scared it won't get better
I'll be stuck in here forever
Don't tell me it's a life sentence
Life sеntence

[Verse 2]
You, you taught me lovе and taught me truth
Now all that's left are little clues
The camera that you never used
It kinda hurt me, you ignored it
Why did you ignore it
Mmm

[Pre-Chorus]
And oh, I'm so, so sorry
But oh, don't know if I can let you go
Let you go, let you go

[Chorus]
'Cause I try, but can't avoid it
Every day I'm disappointed
Don't tell me it's a life sentence
Life sentence
And I'm scared it won't get better
I'll be stuck in here forever
Don't tell me it's a life sentence
Life sentence

[Pre-Chorus]
And oh, I'm so, so sorry
But oh, don't know if I can let you go
Let you go, let you go

[Chorus]
'Cause I try, but can't avoid it
Every day I'm disappointed
Don't tell me it's a life sentence
Life sentence
And I'm scared it won't get better
I'll be stuck in here forever
Don't tell me it's a life sentence
Life sentence


Title: Loaded

Lyrics:
Cold, bring me back in
You've been here from the beginning
Ain't it easy to drink, like the bottle's never out
Doesn't seem so when you're living
Ain't it easy to think that you got it figured out
Til the water gets in

But sure as the call comes through
Then I'll stumble back to your place to make it easier on you
And when it's time, when it's time
Then I'll stumble back to your place to make it easier on you

So show me to bed
On a cloud of indecision
Ain't it easy to think, that you're fine this time around
Oh the ride was more forgiving?
Ain't it easy to think that you got it figured out
Til the water gets in

But sure as the call comes through
Then I'll stumble back to your place to make it easier on you
And when it's time, when it's time
Then I'll stumble back to your place to make it easier on you
And if I'm loaded when I see you makes it easier to do

Oh what would she trade me?
Oh the cost of my bones

Ain't it easy to think that you got it figured out
Til the water gets in
But sure as the call comes through
Then I'll stumble back to your place
To make it easier on you
If it's easier
Then I'll stumble back to your place to make it easier
I'll be loaded back at your place to make it easier


Title: Losing You

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Hon, I wanna be your favorite
What's done, can't go back and change it

[Pre-Chorus]
I say dumb shit outta desperation
When the only thing I should be saying
Is, "I'm all wrong and you're alright"

[Chorus]
I know I should learn to shut my mouth
I'm the only one that fights like you do
Maybe I'm the one to sit this out
Don't wanna be right if it means losing you
Oh, losing you

[Verse 2]
Rage rips apart a good thing
Insane, screaming over nothing

[Pre-Chorus]
I say dumb shit tryna fight my ego
But it follows us everywhere we go
Still, I'm all wrong and you're alright

[Chorus]
I know I should learn to shut my mouth
I'm the only one that fights like you do
Maybe I'm the one to sit this out
Don't wanna be right if it means losing you
Oh, losing you

[Chorus]
I know I should learn to shut my mouth
I'm the only one that fights likе you do
Maybe I'm the one to sit this out
Don't wanna bе right if it means losing you
Oh, losing you

[Outro]
Oh, losing you
(I know I should learn to shut my mouth)
(I'm the only one that fights like you do)
(I know I should learn to shut my mouth)
(I'm the only one that fights like you do)


Title: Lost My Cat / Put in a Cage

Lyrics:
I love like a child, laugh when I can
And fight like an ignorant man
And I smoke, I smoke for the rush
To keep my head above all the things that she does

In the end, I guess she’ll figure out
Until then I’m sleeping in

I sold everything I kept in my house
And filled it instead with a horrible sound
The beat of a drum, a crack and a hiss
If I’m not her one than I’m only for kicks

But it’s not over now
Until then I’m filled with doubt

But I’m not innocent
I’m livid and bold, well I’m young and sick of it

I, I want to live down by the sea
Where no one will listen to me and my thoughts
Drunk in the brain and hoping my shame
Could fill all the cracks in the wall


Title: Love Song for Lady Earth

Lyrics:
Now
More than any man I know
I strap a spacesuit to my chest
And watch the planet that I left, it rises slow
More than any dream I've dreamt
With her Cailin Russo neck
I can see her from the deck out by the road
More than any girl I've had
She could drink and take a drag
When you're young, that's all you have, and this I know

Love's not simple here anymore
And I've gone mental over how to leave this world and go back home

She
More than any pretty thing
I will miss her most of all
When her towers start to fall into the sea
More than any life I'd lead
I know that one was the best
'Cause I spent it on my chest between her knees
And her rivers, still they run
When they crash into the sun
In some life will I be young enough to see?

Love's not simple here anymore
And I've gone mental over how to leave this world and go back home

Yeah, love's not simple here anymore
And I've gone mental over how to leave this world and go back home

More than any time before
I think I finally figured out
Being happy with yourself and with your life

We got pretty stoned
With your hands on your chest
And my ego
And we, we clung to the roof
And the morning laid rest all around you
And I won't forget how you looked in that dress
On the day that first I met you

You had all your friends
And a camera to make them look vintage
And I, I felt like a king
When you leaned yourself into my window
To sing me a song that I wrote for my mom
On the day that first I met you

And it only took a day
With that tattoo of yours, and the look on your face

You told marry you quick
And I think that you're funny
So much so I think
That I could be your baby
And I still regret every word that I said
On the day that first I met you


Title: Lying on the Floor

Lyrics:
Is this just a song you’ve written
Or is it really what you see?
Behind your eyes there’s something different
“What the hell is wrong with me?”

And every night your floor breaks open
The devil’s sitting in your room
But if the pills can’t kill the demons
Then they must be killing you

When you’re lying on the floor
Just think of me, and drag yourself to the wall
You said you lost yourself, but you never felt before
And when it comes back, it’s like it never left at all

Your parents always use their wisdom
They love you but they can’t understand
Your brother’s always been your hero
You’ll keep him healthy when you can

Kids with jazz guitars and egos
Can turn an honest heart to stone
You’ll free yourself this love addiction
Aria, leave my friend alone

When you’re lying on the floor
Just think of me and drag yourself to the wall
You said you lost yourself, but you never felt before
But when it comes back, it’s like it never left at all

I would give you my mind
I would open your eyes
I would sing you to sleep, this is your lullaby

I would give you my mind
I would open your eyes
Will you treat me the same, if I don’t let you die

I would kill all the voices
The horrible sounds
You’re a friend I know I won’t be leaving without

I would kill all the voices
The horrible sounds
Drown the man in his suit, please keep the needle out yeah

When you’re lying on the floor
Just think of me, and drag yourself to the wall
You said you lost yourself, but you’ve never felt before
But when it comes back, it’s like it never left at all

When you’re lying on the floor
Just think of me, and drag yourself to the wall
You said you lost yourself, but you’ve never felt before
But when it comes back, it’s like it never left at all

Is this just a song you’ve written
Or is it really what you see?
Behind your eyes there’s something different
Is it really what you see?


Title: Mariposa

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Thank my mom for home and thank my god for health
If not for all this lonesome, would I be myself?
Oh, the irony of slipping back to yours
After these autumn weeks, unbuttoning your shorts
We close the bedroom door

[Chorus]
Getting alone with you was hard enough
The first time I was alone with you (Ah)
Getting alone with you was hard enough
The first time I was alone with you (Ah)
I knew

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ah

[Verse 2]
From the mattress, ashing through your windowpane
Sorry I let the cat out on on the fire escape
Oh, the mastery you're keeping me in bed
Clicking your tongue to teeth, unsettled like a debt
You stare at me like we've not met

[Chorus]
Getting alone with you was hard enough
The first time I was alone with you (Ah)
Getting alone with you was hard enough
The first time I was alone with you (Ah)
I knew

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ah

[Outro]
Getting alone with you was hard enough
The first time I was alone with you


Title: Milk Money

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Shadows they follow me home
Do you feel it?
Took it just an hour ago
Do you feel it?

[Chorus]
Give me all your milk money
Stash it in my backpack
I’ll make you a man honey if you need that
If you need that
I can be your detox I can be your relapse

Give me all your milk money
Stash it in my backpack
I’ll make you a man honey if you need that
If you need that
I can be your detox I can be your relapse

[Verse 2]
Aching to move it along
Can you hurry?
Hesitate killing me slow
Like I’m  burning

[Chorus]
Give me all your milk money
Stash it in my backpack
I’ll make you a man honey if you need that
If you need that
I can be your detox I can be your relapse

Give me all your milk money
Stash it in my backpack
I’ll make you a man honеy if you need that
If you need that
I can be your detox I can be your rеlapse

[Bridge]
I’ll make you wait
No fuss heartbreak
On the bath floor laying heavy in the hay
Out the back door baby be my runaway
On the bath floor laying heavy in the hay
Out the back door baby be my runaway
On the bath floor laying heavy in the hay
Out the back door baby be my runaway
On the bath floor laying heavy in the hay
Out the back door baby be my runaway

[Chorus]
Give me all your milk money
Stash it in my backpack
I’ll make you a man honey if you need that
If you need that
I can be your detox I can be your relapse

Give me all your milk money
Stash it in my backpack
I’ll make you a man honey if you need that
If you need that
I can be your detox I can be your relapse

[Outro]
On the bath floor laying heavy in the hay
Out the back door baby be my runaway
On the bath floor laying heavy in the hay
Out the back door baby be my runaway
On the bath floor laying heavy in the hay
Out the back door baby be my runaway


Title: My Body

Lyrics:
Right now I need your love
In the bathroom stall
Hip to hip if you want to

Now we're face to face
And no one's in the way
Kiss me hard like I ask you

And I already know
Already know
I figured it out
I think I figured you out

You only want me for my body
You only want me for my body
My body
You only want me for my body

One hand on my thigh
And I close my eyes
Give me something to dance to

Don't put me on hold
I'm so emotional
Don't get me something to cry to

And I already know
Already know
I figured it out
I think I figured you out

You only want me for my body
You only want me for my body
My body
You only want me for my body

Tell me to wait but it's
Already late so I leave my door open
For when you get lonesome
Quietly praying
You still found your way to your
Place in my bedroom
I wake up beside you
The look on your face could make
Me think its fate when you're
Totally naked
Except for my blanket
My body
You only want me for my body

You only want me for my body
You only want me for my body
My body
You only want me for my body

You only want me for my body
You only want me for my body
My body
You only want me for my body

The look on your face could make
Me think it's fate when you're totally naked


Title: Never Meant To Call

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I'm halfway there
Happened to stop by Courtney's
Bought you some shit you don't need
I'm halfway there
Hope you don't see me coming
I might be walking funny
I might be

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a plan to take you by the hand
Till I saw you leaning her against your door

[Chorus]
Never meant to call, never meant to call
Never meant to call when she's in your room
Never meant to call, never meant to call
Never meant to call when she's in your room
(Never meant to call when she's in your room)

[Verse 2]
Where went my day?
I hope you know you caught me
Can't seem to say the right thing
Still on my way
Showed up too high to dump me
I might be walking funny
I might be

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a plan to take you by the hand
Till I saw you leaning her against your door

[Chorus]
Never meant to call, never meant to call
Never meant to call when she's in your room
Never meant to call, never meant to call
Never meant to call when she's in your room
Never meant to call, never meant to call
Never meant to call when she's in your room
Never meant to call when she's in your room
Never meant to call when she's in your room
I'm halfway there
Never meant to call when she's in your room
I'm halfway there
Never meant to call when she's in your room

[Outro]
(Never meant to call when she's in your room
Never meant to call when she's in your room)


Title: New Song

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Del Water Gap]
And, darling
Is there a cure for this hunger?
A terrible curse to be under
I'll be sleeping with that
And it's no small thing
You'll smoke me out in your own ways
And chase me around until morning
And follow me back

[Verse 2: Maggie Rogers]
And, lovely
You're tearing me down with your cheekbones
They're warm, but they hit me like sharp stones
When you pull away
Now I walk slow
And wander the streets in the morning
I still smell your scent like a warning
When the wind blows
Oh, when the wind blows

[Verse 3: Del Water Gap]
So, leave me
When you're sleeping alone in the basement
And my parents are home, but I'm vacant
And I'm watching the news
Because I'm slow now
I'm young, but I feel like an old man
The tar in my lungs and these cold hands
They held onto you

[Verse 4: Maggie Rogers]
No, keep me
Inside of your mind when you're aching
Lord, 'cause for now, we're mistaken
In thinking we fit
But I'll stay steady, but nights are a-blazing and heavy
Alone in my room and I'm ready
To rest for a while
Oh, to rest for a while

[Refrain: Maggie Rogers, Del Water Gap, Maggie Rogers & Del Water Gap]
Oh, but I don't mind it
I don't mind it
I don't mind, honey, I don't mind
Oh, but I don't mind it
I don't mind it
I don't mind it
I don't mind it
I don't mind it
And I don't mind it
I'll wait and I'll listen
I don't mind it
And see through to the kitchen
I don't mind it
I'm not taking it back
Oh, and I don't mind it
I don't mind it
I don't mind it
I don't mind it

[Outro: Maggie Rogers]
I don't mind it
I don't mind it, I
Oh, honey, I don't mind


Title: NFU

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I don't wanna go home
But I don't wanna stay here
Does your boyfriend know where you've gone?
Does he think it means nothing?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, what he don't know
Won't hurt him
But it kills me

[Chorus]
I'm not fucked up
I just miss the way that you talk, yeah
And I'm sorry
I still love you, you say it's okay but it's not
Oh, it's not, yeah

[Verse 2]
The underpart of your arms
How I miss that smell
I swear I won't be alarmed
If you say this means nothing

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, what he (Oh, what he) don't know (Don't know)
Won't hurt him
But it kills me

[Chorus]
I'm not fucked up
I just miss the way that you talk, yeah
And I'm sorry
I still love you, you say it's okay but it's not
Oh, it's not, yeah

[Bridge]
Was what we had the best?
Or is it all in my head?
That's the funny thing about memories
You can never trust 'em
Was what we had the best?
Or is it all in my head?
That's the funny thing about memories
You can never trust 'em
I'm afraid that I'll die without you
Die not knowing if you were the one
There's no way that you're not
I'm sorry

[Chorus]
I'm not fucked up
I just miss the way that you talk, yeah
And I'm sorry
I still love you, you say it's okay but it's not
Oh, it's not, yeah

[Outro]
Oh, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Oh, you say it's okay but it's not
Oh, it's not, yeah
I'm not fucked up
I just miss the way that we talked, yeah


Title: Night Vision

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I think I can see in the dark
The power's been out for so long
I still turn the switches on
Just to see if it's still gone

[Verse 2]
The blood in the water's mine
From scraping my knees all the time
On all of the shards that I find
Little traps I set out overnight

[Pre-Chorus]
And when the sky's looking starless
Searching for light in the distance
Until I find that the darkness was only shade

[Chorus]
Ho-oh
I quiet my mind, I'm doing okay
Oh
Quiet my mind

[Verse 3]
Parked on the way to the top
Took a moment to sit and sulk
Give the audience what they want
'Till it hits I'm the only one

[Pre-Chorus]
And when the sky's looking starless
Searching for light in the distance
Until I find that the darkness was only shade

[Chorus]
Ho-oh
I quiet my mind, I'm doing okay
Oh
I quiet my mind

[Bridge]
Can't believe anyone, really lives just for fun
Build it up and throw it away
Is it ever enough, just to want what you want
Praying that it's not a waste

[Chorus]
Ho-oh
I quiet my mind, I'm doing okay
Oh
I quiet my mind


Title: No Fear, Dragon Here

Lyrics:
I met a man who was an artist
But his parents told him not to chase his dreams
Now he’s cooking lunch for high school punks and teachers
And the kids they never ask him how he’s been
Yeah, the kids they never ask him how he's been

Don’t you ask me to settle in
Don’t you ask this of me
Keep your body listening, I’ll keep you close to me
I wanna warm your mother’s heart, the way we used to be
I wanna warm your mother’s heart, and your father’s heart

We were friends, we were more
We were lying on the floor and you asked me
“Will you want me in the morning?”
Take me in, take me home
Somewhere we could be alone
And put your lipstick back
I’ll take you as you are

I met a girl on the subway
Yeah I waited half an hour in the wind
But she left me broke with none to smoke but my feeling
If I see her again I’ll just ask her where she’s been

Now I don’t mean to sound pessimistic
Cause the cynic weaves his curtains full of lies
And troubadours are nothing more than preachers
In the end we’re all just sad and weak inside
In the end we're all just sad and weak inside

Don’t you ask me to settle in
Don’t you ask this of me
Keep your body listening, I’ll keep you close to me
I wanna warm your mother’s heart, the way we used to be
I wanna warm your mother’s heart, and your father’s heart

Be my muse, who’s your man
Wash him clean with dirty hands
And lick your wounds until he finally goes away
Take me in, take me home

Somewhere we could be alone
And put your lipstick back
I’ll take you as you are

This is war, I’m no man
Wash your number from my hands
I don’t wanna watch my family fall apart
Take me in, you’re my home
Maybe we could be alone
And put your lipstick back
I’ll take you as you are
And put your lipstick back
I’ll take you as you are


Title: Ode to a Conversation Stuck in Your Throat

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I do not want to fight this anymore
I just want to lay back and watch you pin me to the bed
I used to call you my best friend way back before you were my everything
Now I'm sucking your neck
And you wrote my favorite song
Now I'm fucked up and carrying on
I do not know the words to it yet, oh

[Chorus]
And it hits me
I don't want anybody else touching you like I do
Like I do, like me
Is it okay?
That I don't want anybody else touching you like I do
Like I do, like me (Yeah)

[Post-Chorus]
Tell me that nobody else touches you like I do, like I do
Oh, tell me that nobody else touches you like me
Tell me that nobody else touches you like I do, like I do
Oh, tell me that nobody else touches you like me

[Verse 2]
You're pulling on my habit lines
The more I smoke the more I find
I can't just fall asleep instead
And you're not my protector I hope you know it wasn't her
That kept me off your side of the bed, oh

[Chorus]
And it hits me
I don't want anybody else touching you like I do
Like I do, like me
Is it okay?
That I don't want anybody else touching you like I do
Like I do, like me

[Bridge]
(You're in his living room)
And it may not mean much to you
But your plates are in his sink
And your sweater's on his bed
Won't you text me when you're home
My baby, spare me all the rest

[Pre-Chorus]
Please just tell me that nobody else touches you like I do
Oh, tell me that nobody else touches you like me

[Chorus]
And it hits me
I don't want anybody else touching you like I do
Like I do, like me
Is it okay?
That I don't want anybody else touching you like I do
Like I do, like me


Title: Perfume

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
When we're playing pool, I'm in love in a dive bar
It ain't our parents' story, but I'll take it and try hard
To keep my focus on the table
Faded blue jeans, you said you bleached them with your mom
Folded over cuffs as if they were too long
You wrote your number on the label

[Chorus]
And I'm picturing you right now
I'm thinking of you right now

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I wanna do all of the things, baby, I said I wanna do with you
Unless this is a lie, and I don't know myself like I thought
Wait, this is a mess, I could be wrong
I could be so damn mistaken

[Chorus]
But I'm picturing you right now
I'm thinking of you right now
I'm picturing you right now with nothing on
With nothing on but your perfume
Call me in the morning, beg me in the night
I'll be over safely if you need it anytime
I'm picturing you right now with nothing on
With nothing on but your perfume

[Verse 2]
Bending over backwards to stay up in your head
Did I waste it all falling back with an old friend?
I don't believe what this has come to
You tell me when you're older you'll run back to the forest
To get a little distance from the buildings and tourists
I was hoping I could come, too

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I wanna do all of the things, baby, I said I wanna do with you
'Less this is a lie, and I don't know myself like I thought
Wait, this is a mess, I could be wrong
I could be so damn mistaken

[Chorus]
But I'm picturing you right now
I'm thinking of you right now
I'm picturing you right now with nothing on
With nothing on but your perfume
Call me in the morning, beg me in the night
I'll be over safely if you need it anytime
I'm picturing you right now with nothing on
With nothing on but your perfume

[Bridge]
Tell me when you're hurting, we can take a ride
Escape the mess in your apartment, leave your phone behind
'Cause if we started driving early, we'll make it back in time
Or you could call in sick to work, and I could spend the night
You make me wanna know my way around your mind
'Til I can make it through your mazes, and when you master mine
You'll find that, baby, like I told you, any given night
I'll be over safely if you need it anytime

[Chorus]
I'm picturing you right now
I'm thinking of you right now
I'm picturing you right now with nothing on
With nothing on but your perfume
Call me in the morning, beg me in the night
I'll be over safely if you need it anytime
I'm picturing you right now with nothing on
With nothing on but your perfume

I'm thinking of you right now

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I wanna do all of the things, baby, I said I wanna do with you
Unless this is a lie, and I don't know myself like I thought
Wait, this is a mess, I could be wrong
I could be so damn mistaken

[Chorus]
But I'm picturing you right now
I'm thinking of you right now
I'm picturing you right now with nothing on
With nothing on but your perfume
Call me in the morning, beg me in the night
I'll be ovеr safely if you need it anytime
I'm picturing you right now with nothing on
With nothing on but your perfumе

[Verse 2]
Bending over backwards to stay up in your head
Did I waste it all falling back with an old friend?
I don't believe what this has come to
You tell me when you're older you'll run back to the forest
To get a little distance from the buildings and tourists
I was hoping I could come, too

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I wanna do all of the things, baby, I said I wanna do with you
'Less this is a lie, and I don't know myself like I thought
Wait, this is a mess, I could be wrong
I could be so damn mistaken

[Chorus]
But I'm picturing you right now
I'm thinking of you right now
I'm picturing you right now with nothing on
With nothing on but your perfume
Call me in the morning, beg me in the night
I'll be over safely if you need it anytime
I'm picturing you right now with nothing on
With nothing on but your perfume

[Bridge]
Tell me when you're hurting, we can take a ride
Escape the mess in your apartment, leave your phone behind
'Cause if we started driving early, we'll make it back in time
Or you could call in sick to work, and I could spend the night
You make me wanna know my way around your mind
'Til I can make it through your mazes, and when you master mine
You'll find that, baby, like I told you, any given night
I'll be over safely if you need it anytime

[Chorus]
I'm picturing you right now
I'm thinking of you right now
I'm picturing you right now with nothing on
With nothing on but your perfume
Call me in the morning, beg me in the night
I'll be over safely if you need it anytime
I'm picturing you right now with nothing on
With nothing on but your perfume


Title: Quilt of Steam

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Del Water Gap & Arlo Parks]
I didn't know where I was until a month or so later
When I woke up saw the quilt of steam rise off the radiator
Sweatin' through the layers, stitched in my own hand
On and on for acres

[Pre-Chorus: Del Water Gap & Arlo Parks]
All I ever wanted was for you to take a second
Drop it all to sit with me
Waiting in the car wonderin' if you would address it
Or just leave me hurtin' quietly

[Chorus: Del Water Gap & Arlo Parks]
I needed a change, but I wasn't brave enough
I needed a beer and a hug and a way out of the crater
I needed a change, so we wouldn't fall out of love
I couldn't admit I was crushed by the weight of being strangers

[Verse 2: Del Water Gap & Arlo Parks]
I carried on foldin' clothes alone as if it wasn't treason
Actin' strong, I just moved along as if it didn't happen
Stoic like a captain, no compass in my hand
Just hold me 'til it passes

[Pre-Chorus: Del Water Gap & Arlo Parks]
All I ever wanted was for you to take a second
Drop it all to sit with me
Waitin' in the car wonderin' if you would address it
Or just leave me hurtin' quietly

[Chorus: Del Water Gap & Arlo Parks]
I needed a change, but I wasn't brave enough
I needed a beer and a hug and a way out of the crater
I needed a change, so we wouldn't fall out of love
I couldn't admit I was crushed by the weight of being strangers
I needed a change, but I wasn't brave enough
I needed a beer and a hug and a way out of the crater
I needed a change so we wouldn't fall out of love
I couldn't admit I was crushed by the weight of being strangers


Title: Rockman’s Pier

Lyrics:
Darling don’t you throw me to the wolves
She whispered as her voice it shook
She’s never seen a good man fall
So I tuck my tail and forget it all
She’s nappy hair and sunken cheeks
Yeah she almost got the best of me
She keeps my picture on her shelf
Yeah she’s fickle and she hates herself
She hates herself

She won’t say, she won’t say she won’t say
Yeah I ask her but it’s one thing she won’t say
She won’t say, she won’t say she won’t say
Yeah I ask her but it’s one thing she won’t say-

Her makeup turned her little face all red
So I told her not to wear it then
She was looking more like beast than girl
We found love in this forsaken world

She left her heart on Rockman’s Pier
On a river far away from here
In the mountain air and the whiskey run
Yeah she used to cry when she was young
When she was young

She won’t say, she won’t say she won’t say
Yeah I ask her but it’s one thing she won’t say
She won’t say, she won’t say she won’t say
Yeah I ask her but it’s one thing she won’t say

She won’t say, she won’t say she won’t say
Yeah I ask her but it’s one thing she won’t say
She won’t say, she won’t say she won’t say
Yeah I ask her but it’s one thing she won’t say
Yeah I ask her but it’s one thing she won’t say
Yeah I ask her but it’s one thing she won’t say


Title: Saints

Lyrics:
Late night, blurry vision
You and me back in this position
Hang tight, baby listen
When you wanna leave, take me by the wrist
And let’s go missing
Fall into your bed with that hunger in your eyes
I can only pray your roommate took her Ambien tonight

Folks can call us juvenile, we can call them jealous
We believe that staying young’s a choice
No matter what they tell us
No matter what they tell us

They say what, what a shame
But we ain’t the kind to go and change
We stay astray misbehave nowadays
Cuz we ain’t tryna be saints
Cuz we ain’t tryna be, tryna be saints
Cuz we ain’t tryna be, tryna be saints

Slow dance on the bleachers
I love it when you’re smoking in that old Nirvana t-shirt
Slow jams on your broken speakers
Life and times of the dreamers and the simple creatures
Fill your paper coffee cups with seven dollar wine
Your roommate’s probably praying that we’ll sleep at mine tonight

She can call us juvenile, we can call her jealous
We believe that staying young’s a choice
No matter what they tell us
No matter what they tell us

They say what, what a shame
But we ain’t the kind to go and change
We stay astray misbehave nowadays
Cuz we ain’t tryna be saints
Cuz we ain’t tryna be, tryna be saints
Cuz we ain’t tryna be, tryna be saints

Honestly my fear of missing out will be the death of me
Can’t say no to saying yes at every opportunity
Holy Spirit I can feel it in my bones, oh
I’m no sinner but together I just might forsake my soul

They say what, what a shame
But we ain’t the kind to go and change
We stay astray misbehave nowadays
Cuz we ain’t tryna be saints
Cuz we ain’t tryna be, tryna be saints
Cuz we ain’t tryna be, tryna be saints
Cuz we ain’t tryna be, tryna be saints


Title: Shortest Love Song

Lyrics:
[Verse]
Is our love the hurting kind?
I fear to say it is but I'm just guessing
Say you've wished I'd move to Spain
Or that one of us would die of hypertension
And you're sorry but your feet might stink
You simply can’t do laundry with your schedule
And I say, "I miss my best friend
But babies need to eat, they beg attention"
Oh, how I've missed you
Could you let me know
If you've been lonesome too and can I kiss you?


Title: Slow Down

Lyrics:
I woke up this morning and saw you next to me
I thought I’d wake you darling, but instead I let you sleep
You looked so beautiful like that

And so I walked on down the stairs after putting on my robe
I put your flowers by the window sill and the coffee on the stove
The smell almost made me laugh

And on the TV I saw dictators bring war to foreign lands
And out the window business people running, briefcases in hand
And I thought, “Why can’t you relax?”

If we could just slow down
We could look around and take some time
If we could only slow down
I know everything would be alright
If we could just slow down
We could look around and take some time
If we could only slow down
I know everything would be alright

You came down as the hours passed and I’ll never forget
How you came into the kitchen and wrapped your arms around my neck
Oh, you wrapped your arms around me

There were cigarettes broken bottles littering the stairs
They were left there from the night before but I know you didn’t care
I know you didn’t care

And so you grabbed a cup and looked at me, the sun was in your eyes
You had this look of utter innocence, but that’s what makes you mine
Oh, that’s what makes you mine

If we could just slow down
We could look around and take some time
If we could only slow down
I know everything would be alright
If we could just slow down
We could look around and take some time
If we could only slow down
I know everything would be alright


Title: Something To Miss

Lyrics:
[Intro]
(Something like that)

[Verse 1]
Read in to what you never said
Know I'm far, but you're in my head
And I'd change anything to love you like you need
Would you do the same for me?

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm in the dark
Do you ever care?
Counterfeit parts put me together again
I'm getting sick, can't see the floor
Am I something to miss? Do you want this anymore?

[Post-Chorus]
Anymore
Anymore
Anymore
Do you want this anymore?
Anymore
Oh-oh, do you want this anymore?

[Verse 2]
Fall asleep on your shoulder again
Forget everything you said
And I'd change anything to love you like you need
Would you follow would you want me

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm in the dark
Do you evеr care?
Counterfeit parts put mе together again
I'm getting sick, can't see the floor
Am I something to miss? Do you want this anymore?

[Post-Chorus]
Do you want this anymore?
Anymore
Anymore

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm in the dark
Do you ever care?
Counterfeit parts put me together again
I'm getting sick, can't see the floor
Am I something to miss? Do you want this anymore? (Anymore, anymore)
Do you want this anymore? (Anymore)
Oh-oh-oh
Do you want this anymore?


Title: Sorry I Am

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I wish I could tell you
How sorry I am
Have you found someone new?
A Christian man?
And what do you tell your friends?
"It just went down like that"
And are they terribly impressed?
What do they say behind your back?

[Verse 2]
I wish I could tell you
You're drop dead kind
You're easy to talk to
And you're generous with time
And where are you living now?
And have you changed up your hair?
(Have you changed your hair?)
And do you keep my friends around?
For purposes unclear
For purposes unclear
For purposes unclear

[Outro]
I don't think I'm ready, I don't think I'm ready, no
Tell me you'll forgive me, tell me you'll forget it all
I don't think I'm ready, I don't think I'm ready, no
Tell me you'll forgive me, tell me you'll forget it all
I don't think I'm ready, I don't think I'm ready, no
Tell me you'll forgive me, tell me you'll forget it all
I don't think I'm ready, I don't think I'm ready, no
I don't think I'm ready, I don't think I'm ready


Title: Stay With Me

Lyrics:

Title: Still in Love

Lyrics:
And darling won’t you smother all your demons, I’ll wait patiently
You ground your little teeth to dust, I held the pieces but you cut my knees
I remember sheets of cotton, window panes on sills gone rotten
If only I had know that, yeah if only I had known

And I am still in love
Yeah I am still in love

And sleep, I strip the sheets, because you’re more, yeah I smoke you clean
And dear, you naked thief, a bigger man would fucking leave
Smoking blacks and sleeping past noon, lowly backlit nights in classrooms
If only I had known that, yeah if only I had known

And I am still in love
Yeah I am still in love

Do you love me? Have I lost it? I don’t know
Would you throw me in the closet? I don’t know
Have you found him? I’ve forgotten who’s your man
You could throw me all to pieces with your plans
Yeah with your plans

And I am still in love
Yeah I am still in love
And I am still in love
Yeah I am still in love


Title: Terrified

Lyrics:
Ain't tryna blow your cover
But how'd ya pull me under?
You could make a dead man laugh

When we're out and drinkin
Start to lose your diction
Love it when you talk like that

Have you no idea?
How you got me feeling?
I'm tortured and I'm reeling over you

Tell me why do I love being terrified?
What kind of fool feeds on their own hurt to kill the time, kill the time?
Help me why do I love being terrified?
To tell the truth you might not be worth that terrified state of mind
Terrified, terrified, terrified state of mind
Terrified, terrified, terrified state of mind

Want me when you want me
Pick me up and drop me
Hold me at a full arm's length

Told me to be open
Just to leave me lonesome
Love it when you move that way

Have you no idea?
How badly I am dealing?
I'm tortured and I'm reeling over you

Tell me why do I love being terrified?
What kind of fool feeds on their own hurt to kill the time, kill the time?
Help me why do I love being terrified?
To tell the truth you might not be worth that terrified state of mind
Terrified, terrified, terrified state of mind
Terrified, terrified, terrified state of mind

Tell me why do I love being terrified?
What kind of fool feeds on their own hurt to kill the time, kill the time?
Help me why do I love being terrified?
To tell the truth you might not be worth that terrified state of mind
Terrified, terrified, terrified state of mind
Terrified, terrified, terrified state of mind


Title: Theory of Emotion

Lyrics:
Hey, when she looks sad
I get horribly nostalgic for the times we had
Throwing plates, surprise attack
Yeah we fought like we were acting in an improv class

But through it all we still managed to laugh

Do you take me as I am?
Cause I’ll take you as I am
And I don’t take things lightly
And I feel nothing mostly all the time
Am I dead behind the eyes from loving you too tightly?

That reminds me
Of a poster I saw hanging at the dentist
I was late for my appointment
But the lady at the desk was awfully patient

She said, “Honey won’t you sit across from me?
Pour yourself a coffee, choose a magazine.”
And I said

Do you take me as I am?
Cause I’ll take you as I am
And I don’t take things lightly
And I feel nothing mostly all the time
Am I dead behind the eyes from loving you too tightly?

Do you take me as I am?
Cause I’ll take you as I am
And I don’t take things lightly
And I feel nothing mostly all the time
Am I dead behind the eyes from loving you too tightly?
Too tightly?


Title: Thief

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
My head's too crowded all the time
The colors drown me out
Until I'm too far gone to mind
That nothing's figured out
So when you find me in the sand
Broken by the sea
Don't look for me inside my body
'Cause that's not where I'll be

[Verse 2]
I keep wandering up and down the highway, staring at the cars
At least they know their own direction
You need a warranty for stars
So when you catch me in the rearview, above your empty seat
Don't look for me inside my body
'Cause that's not where I'll be

[Chorus]
Ooh, I think I'm pushing my luck too far
Trying to get back to whеre we are
In unfamiliar skin
Ooh, I'm at thе edge of the universe
So does it matter if I get hurt?
If I'm on my way back in

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh

[Verse 3]
Woke up this morning with a fast heart, couldn't slow it down
Next thing I know I'm in a fast car, too late to turn around
Don't tell nobody but I stole it
So when you look at me
Just know you're looking at a stranger
And you're loved by a thief

[Post-Chorus]
No
Ooh, oh, oh-oh, oh


Title: To Philly

Lyrics:
When you’re drunk you love sending me photos of you with nothing on but your shoes
When I sleep late always have some kind of dreams of you
I will not mention what we do

When I wake up it’s almost supper
And you come back to haunt me, don’t you?

You shaved your head just two days before I met you with your best friend in your room
I thought you were by far the prettiest girl in the room with no hair hiding none of you

When it grows back you’ll find another
And you’ll go back to Philly, won’t you?

On your wall you hung that sock I left in your room
Was it Hanes or Fruit Of The Loom?
On your laptop saw that sticker I gave to you
With my band name written right through it

When it peels off you’ll want another
Then you’ll go back to Philly, won’t you?

You’ll go back, you’ll go back
You’ll go back and live in that apartment where you’ll learn to be alone
Picture that, picture that
Picture me drunk calling you on Friday nights
Begging you to meet me halfway love

I pray your mom ain’t lonely in that big old house in the suburbs
Do you reckon she misses her daughter?
Do you reckon she’d find another
If you don’t go back to Philly, lover?


Title: Uh-Huh

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I took a room down by the beach
With humble hands I cook and sweep
She combs her hair
She comes then leaves
I want her back, nakedly
A sun filled room, a bed to sleep
A friendly neighbor to wave at me
These simple things I'll always need
When she's too famous to move with me

[Chorus]
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh

[Verse 2]
I don't care what people say
Robert Pattinson don't feel like me
I make some lunch, I run 5K
Will you still love me when I'm sober, babe?

[Chorus]
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh


Title: Vanessa

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I am so in love with her
But I am so unhappy
She's so smooth but insecure
I wanna tell her don't be

She wears black or black on black
I wanna see her brighten
And see her lift her legs right from my lap

[Chorus]
Oh no I think I've fallen in it
Oh no it isn't any use
Oh well I should have left her sooner

[Verse 2]
She says it's so cheap to think
The afterlife is given
One shot's it you're born and live
And then you're good as nothin'

[Chorus]
Oh no I think I've fallen in it
Oh no it isn't any use
Oh well I guess my word means nothing

[Bridge]
I just wanted to tell her
I won't deal with this peacefully
No I'm just not like that

I just wanted to tell her
To walk out for a piece of me
Cause he'll take you right back

Na na na, na na na na, na na na na na naaa (2x)

[Chorus]
Oh no I think I've fallen in it
Oh no it isn't any use
Oh well I should have left her sooner

[Outro]
Oh well I should have left her sooner


Title: Want It All

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Thinkin' 'bout killin' myself all the time
Ain't too good for business
Ain't good for this headache
Ain't good for for my mind

[Verse 2]
Thinkin' 'bout my ex all the time
Ain't good for my lover
I keep it undercover
Somewhere in my mind

[Chorus]
I want it all, want it
No, I want nothing at all
When it comes down to it
I want it all, want it
No, I want nothing at all
When it comes down to it

[Verse 3]
Waitin' for the dogwood to bloom
I've got a funny feeling
It's not still the beginning
Of my life

[Verse 4]
There's an owl outside my room
She's tellin' me to wander
Wake up in the pasture
Give up all this cryin'

[Chorus]
I want it all, want it
No, I want nothing at all
When it comes down to it
I want it all, want it
No, I want nothing at all
When it comes down to it
