Title: 10/10

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Now we're adversaries in a pretty house, yeah
Couldn't tell you what we're even fight 'bout, yeah
That's probably something we should figure out, yeah
Ooh

[Chorus]
'Cause I wanna be a ten out of ten for you
Hit it out of the park
And I wanna be an amen to ya
When you're falling apart
And we're not what we used to be
But let's be what we are (Let's be what we are)

[Verse 2]
With infatuation fading in and out, yeah
Gotta find a piece that keeps us sticking 'round, yeah
I should say I don't have a shred of doubt, yeah
We're alright, 'cause

[Chorus]
I wanna be a ten out of ten for you
Hit it out of the park
And I wanna be an amen to ya
When you're falling apart
And we're not what we used to be
But let's be what we are (Let's be what we are)

[Bridge]
There will be dark days, ooh
Swear that they'll be short
There will be good days, ooh
There'll be so many more
You can always be sure that

[Chorus]
I wanna be a ten out of ten for you
Hit it out of the park
And I wanna be an amen to ya
When you're falling apart
And we're not what we used to be
But let's be what we are (Let's be what we are)


Title: 1999

Lyrics:
[Chorus: Charli XCX with Troye Sivan]
I just wanna go back, back to 1999
Take a ride to my old neighborhood
I just wanna go back, sing "Hit me, baby, one more time"
Wanna go back, wanna go

[Verse 1: Charli XCX]
Yeah, I just wanna go back
Nike Airs, All That
CD, old Mercedes
Drive 'round listening to Shady like, oh
Never under pressure, oh
Those days, it was so much better, oh
Feelin' cool in my youth, relaxin'
No money, no problem
It was easy back then

Ooh, wish that we could go back in time, uh
Got memories
Ooh, maybe we could do it tonight
Tonight's the night

Sing "Hit me, baby, one more time"
Wanna go back, wanna go

[Verse 2: Troye Sivan, Charli XCX & Both]
Yeah, I remember back home
Best friends, all night, no phone
No cares, I was dumb and so young
My room singing Michael Jackson (Hee, hee)
Never under pressure, oh
Those days it was so much better, oh
Feelin' cool in my youth, I'm askin'
"Does anyone remember how we did it back then?"

Ooh, wish that we could go back in time, uh
Got memories
Ooh, maybe we could do it tonight
Tonight's the night
Ah, yeah

Take a ride to my old neighborhood
I just wanna go back
Sing "Hit me, baby, one more time"
Wanna go back, wanna go

[Post-Chorus: Charli XCX, Troye Sivan & Both]
Back to where we came from
Playin' air guitar on the roof
In the kitchen, up on the table
Like we had a beautiful view
I wanna go
I just wanna go back, back to 1999
Ah, yeah

[Bridge: Troye Sivan & Charli XCX]
Back to 1999
I know those days are over, but a boy can fantasize
'Bout JTT on MTV and when I close my e-e-eyes
And I'm right there, right there
And he's right there, right there
And we're right there, right there
Ah, ah, ah, I wanna go back

[Chorus: Charli XCX with Troye Sivan]
I just wanna go back (Yeah), back to 1999
Take a ride to my old neighborhood

Sing "Hit me, baby, one more time"
Wanna go back, wanna go

Back to where we came from (Came from)
Playin' air guitar on the roof (Ah)
In the kitchen, up on the table
Like we had a beautiful view

Go back, yeah, yeah
I just wanna go back, yeah, back to 1999
Take me back to '99 (Yeah)


Title: 2099

Lyrics:
[Chorus: Charli XCX & Troye Sivan, Charli XCX]
I pull up, roll up, fuck up
Fast like a Nascar, never touch us
Got visions, levels, they don't get me
Quiet, no discussions, please hush
I pull up, roll up, fuck up
Don't make decisions for me, you don't know nothin'
I'm Pluto, Neptune, pull up, roll up, future, future, ah

Woo, kill it, I'm so deadly, deadly
Ooh, I'm zooming like a jet ski, zoom zoom
Little dose of napalm, blow it up, yeah
Don't care what she talk about, nah
All she wanna do is my style, yeah
No one on my level
I play nice 'cause I'm too clever
I won't show it, never, never, but it's crystal (Woo)
I'm way up, way better
She might pop, but it's whatever
She might sell, but what's she selling?
Does she last long?
I know they write about me (Yeah)
I know that they all see me (Yeah)
Too scared so they don't play me
Some people tried to save me

[Bridge: Charli XCX & Troye Sivan, Charli XCX]
Ooh, but I'm feeling so good
Better than I ever could
Had bad people in my business, gone now
Cage, prison, now it's gone away
They wanna listen what I say
Think I care about the fame?
Na-na-na-na

[Chorus: Charli XCX & Troye Sivan]
I pull up, roll up, fuck up
Fast like a Nascar, never touch us
Got visions, levels, they don't get me

I'm Pluto, Neptune, pull up, roll up, future, future, ah

Fast like a Nascar, never touch us
Got visions, levels, they don't get me

Title: Angel Baby

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I need a lover to keep me sane
Pull me from hell bring me back again
Play me the classics, somethin' romantic
Give him my all when I don't even have it
I always dreamed of a solemn face
Someone who feels like a holiday
But now I'm in pieces, barely believin'
Startin' to think that I've lost all feelin'

[Pre-Chorus]
You came out the blue on a rainy night, no lie
I'll tell you how I almost died
While you're bringin' me back to life

[Chorus]
I just wanna live in this moment forever
'Cause I'm afraid that livin' couldn't gеt any better
Started givin' up on thе word "forever"
Until you gave up heaven so we could be together

[Post-Chorus]
You're my angel, angel baby
Angel, you're my angel baby
Baby, you're my angel, angel baby

[Verse 2]
I'll fall in love with the little things
Countin' the tattoos on your skin
Tell me a secret and, baby, I'll keep it
And maybe we can play house for the weekend

[Pre-Chorus]
You came out the blue on a rainy night, no lie
I'll tell you how I almost died
While you're bringin' me back to life

[Chorus]
I just wanna live in this moment forever
'Cause I'm afraid that livin' couldn't get any better
Started givin' up on the word "forever"
Until you gave up heaven so we could be together

[Post-Chorus]
You're my angel, angel baby
Angel, you're my angel baby
Baby, you're my angel, angel baby

[Bridge]
All the sick and twisted nights that I've been waitin' for ya
They were worth it all along, yeah

[Chorus]
I just wanna live in this moment forever
'Cause I'm afraid that livin' couldn't get any better
Started givin' up on the word "forever" (Ooh, forever)
Until you gave up heaven so we could be together

[Post-Chorus]
You're my angel, angel baby
Angel, you're my angel baby
Baby, you're my angel, angel baby
Angel, angel baby
Angel, you're my angel, baby

Title: Angels Brought Me Here

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
It's been a long and winding journey
But I'm finally here tonight
I'm picking up the pieces
And walking back into the light
Into the sunset of your glory
Where my heart and future lies
There's nothing like that feeling
When I look into your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
My dreams came true, when I found you
I found you, my miracle

[Chorus]
If you could see what I see
That you're the answer to my prayers
And if you could feel the tenderness I feel
You would know, it would be clear
That angels brought me here

[Verse 2]
Standing here beforе you
Feels like I've been born again
Every brеath is your love
Every heartbeat speaks your name

[Pre-Chorus]
My dreams came true
Right here in front of you, my miracle

If you could see what I see
You're the answer to my prayers
And if you could feel the tenderness I feel

Brought me here to be with you
I'll be forever grateful, oh, forever thankful

[Pre-Chorus]
My dreams came true
When I found you, my miracle

[Chorus]
If you could see what I see
You're the answer to my prayers, ohh
If you could feel the tenderness I feel
You would know, it would be clear
That angels brought me here
If you could see what I see
You're the answer to my prayers, oh
And if you could feel the tenderness I feel
You would know, it would be clear
That angels brought me here


Title: Animal

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I told you something safe
Something I've never said before
And I, I, I can't keep my hands off you
While you're lying awake
Covered all in the night before
I'm high, high, high, no one's got me quite like you

[Chorus]
I want you all to myself
Don't leave none for nobody else
I am an animal with you
No angels could beckon me back
And it's hotter than hell where I'm at
I am an animal with you

[Verse 2]
An ode to the boy I love
Boy, I'll die to care for you
You're mine, mine, mine, tell me who do I owe that to?
And as the days fly by
We'll be more than getting through, yeah
And in time, time, time, we'll build a home for two

[Chorus]
I want you all to myself
Don't leave none for nobody else
I am an animal with you
No angels could beckon me back
And it's hotter than hell where I'm at
I am an animal with you

[Bridge]
All is right in the meadow
When I'm lying next to my fellow
Baby, that's you
Baby, that's
Baby, that's you, you-you
One way trip like an arrow
All laid out like a tarot
Baby, that's you
Baby, that's
Baby, that's you, you-you

[Chorus]
I want you all to myself
Don't leave none for nobody else
I am an animal with you
No angels could beckon me back
And it's hotter than hell where I'm at
I am an animal with you
I am an animal with you

Title: Another Lover

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Stay awake, don't fall asleep on me
Watch our smoke in the sky
Close flying by, I
For heaven's sake, just enjoy the breeze
Hear the traffic go by
Sounds of the night, I

[Pre-Chorus]
And babe, the sex is free, these hotel sheets
And the world will freeze, but you and me go
On and on and on
We'll breathe the air selfishly
And feel that sense of urgency go
On and on and on

[Chorus]
I don't want another lover but you
I don't want another lover but you
And even if somebody said that I could choose
I don't want another lover but you, you

[Verse 2]
Take a sip, feel it burn your chest
Warm you inside out
Taste on your mouth when I bite your lip
Now run with it
Let's just see what's next
I don't want to go out
Let's fuck around, I, I

[Pre-Chorus]
Babe, the sex is free, these hotel sheets
And the world will freeze, but you and me go
On and on and on

[Chorus]
I don't want another lover but you
I don't want another lover but you
And even if somebody said that I could choose
I don't want another lover but you, you

[Post-Chorus]
I don't want another lover but you
(I don't want, I don't want no, no)
I don't want another lover but you
(I don't want, I don't want no, no)
And even if somebody said that I could choose (If I could choose)
I don't want another lover but you, you

[Outro]
On and on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on and on
Just you


Title: Better Now

Lyrics:
[Chorus]
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything

[Verse 1]
I did not believe that it would end, no
Everything came second to the Benzo
You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head

[Chorus]
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything

[Verse 2]
I seen you with your other dude
He seemed like he was pretty cool
I was so broken over you
Life it goes on, what can you do?
I just wonder what it’s gonna take
Another foreign or a bigger chain
Because no matter how my life has changed
I just keep on looking back on better days

[Chorus]
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything

[Bridge]
I promise
I swear to you, I'll be okay
You're only the love of my life (love of my life, love of my life)

[Chorus]
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything

Title: BITE

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Kiss me on the mouth and set me free
Sing me like a choir
I can be the subject of your dreams
Your sickening desire
Don't you wanna see a man up close?
A phoenix in the fire

[Chorus]
So kiss me on the mouth and set me free
But please, don't bite

[Verse 2]
You can coax the cold right out of me
Drape me in your warmth
The rapture in the dark puts me at ease
The blind eye of the storm
Let's go for a walk down Easy Street
Where you can be reborn

[Chorus]
And kiss me on the mouth and set me free
But please, don't bite

[Bridge]
Aah, I'm pulling on your heart to push my luck
Aah, 'cause who's got any time for growing up?
Kiss me on the mouth, free
Kiss me on the mouth, free
Kiss me, kiss me on the mouth and set me free
Kiss me on the mouth and set me free
Kiss me on the mouth and set me free
Kiss me on the mouth and set me free
Kiss me on the mouth and set me free

Kiss me on the mouth and set me free
Sing me like a choir
I can be the subject of your dreams
Your sickening desire
Don't you wanna see a man up close?
A phoenix in the fire
So kiss me on the mouth and set me free
But please, don't bite

Lyrics:

All your lights are red, but I'm green to go
Used to see you high, now you're only low
All your lights are red but I'm green to go

Title: Blue Moon

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
In my free
In my wild
In my dark
Oh I started
Started to doubt
Doubt this fire
Lighting up our lives
And it kept me up at night

[Pre-Chorus]
Crash and burn
That's all I know
I think that’s why I made you go
Those three words
You were my first
I can’t help thinking

[Chorus]
Maybe you were my blue moon?
Maybe I let go too soon?
Running from what could be
So terrified of happy
How did I come to lose my blue moon
My blue moon

[Verse 2]
Which one of us went and fucked up
You or me, guess it was me
Don't know a good thing when its right infront of me
‘Cause I’m so numb, what have I become?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, cause' crash and burn
That's all I know
I think that’s why I made you go
Those three words
You were my first
I can’t help thinking

[Chorus]
Maybe you were my blue moon?
Maybe I let go too soon?
Running from what could be
So terrified of happy
How did I come to lose my blue moon
My blue moon

[Pre-Chorus]
Crash and burn
That's all I know
I think that’s why I made you go
Those three words
You were my first
I can’t help thinking

[Chorus]
Maybe you were my blue moon?
Maybe I let go too soon?
Running from what could be
So terrified of happy
How did I come to lose my blue

Maybe you were my blue moon?
Maybe I let go too soon?
Running from what could be
So terrified of happy
How did I come to lose my blue moon

Lyrics:
[Intro: Troye Sivan & Jessica Pratt]
Can't go back, baby
Can't go back, baby
I wish I could but I can't go (Can't go back, baby)
To the days when I thought I knew you

[Verse 1: Troye Sivan]
This is me you're talkin' 'bout
Your only friend
Put your love into the ground
On my big weekend
While I was singin' songs about you
On the TV screen
Don't know how he left the hotel
I wasn't there to see

[Pre-Chorus: Troye Sivan]
In the morning
Your hands around my waist, just us two
In the evening
On my mouth, could you still taste him?

Can't go back, baby
I wish I could but I can't go (Can't go back, baby)
To the days when I thought I knew you (Can't go back, baby)

Can't go back, baby (La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la)

[Verse 2: Troye Sivan]
I wish you weren't dead to me
So much to miss in you
More than just my enemy
You were my lover too
And I hope you forgive yourself
Because I swear I do
And it breaks my heart to say
I can't wait to live without you

[Pre-Chorus: Troye Sivan]
In the morning
Yeah, I wake up with the sun across my face
In the evening
Yeah, I lay with so much love to take your place
And now I

Can't go back, baby (La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la)

Title: COOL

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Sweet life living
Pools and swimming
Drinks in bars and
Boys in cars and
Rooftop sinning
Skinny dipping
Shooting stars with you
Fat cigars and

[Pre-Chorus]
That weekend up in the islands
They stop and stare
Flashes filling the silence
Of a Hollywood love affair
Waking up in the islands
'Cause I saw you there
Lost and tryna be

[Chorus]
I was just tryna be cool
I was just tryna be like you
I'm a spark and you're a boom
What am I supposed to do?

[Verse 2]
Mansion debut
Love it, do you?
Absent father
Pays his daughter
And her mama withdrew
From the life they once knew
She had a heart
But she sold it off for

That weekend up in the islands
They stop and stare
Flashes filling the silence
Of a Hollywood love affair
Waking up in the islands
'Cause I saw you there
Lost and tryna be

I was just tryna be cool
I was just tryna be like you
I'm a spark and you're a boom
What am I supposed to do?

When I've got that cigarette smoke
And Saint Laurent coat, but nothing is feeling right
I drink but I choke, I love but I don't, yeah
I was just tryna be cool
I was just tryna be like you

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I was just tryna be cool
I was just tryna be like you
I'm a spark and you're a boom
What am I supposed to do?

[Post-Chorus]
When I've got that cigarette smoke
And Saint Laurent coat, but nothing is feeling right
I drink but I choke, I love but I don't, yeah
I was just tryna be cool
I was just tryna be like you


Title: Cool (Apple Music at Home with Session)

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Sweet life living
Pools and swimming
Drinks in bars and
Boys in cars and
Rooftop sinning
Skinny dipping
Shooting stars with you
Fat cigars and

[Pre-Chorus]
And that weekend up in the islands
They stop and stare
Flashes filling the silence
Of a Hollywood love affair
Waking up in the islands
Cause I saw you there
Lost and trying to be

[Chorus]
I was just trying to be cool
I was just trying to be like you
I'm a spark and you're a boom
What am I supposed to do?

[Verse 2]
Mansion debut
Love it, do you?
Absent father
Pays his daughter
And her mama withdrew
From the life they once knew
She had a heart
But she sold it off for

[Pre-Chorus]
That weekend up in the islands
They stop and stare
Flashes filling the silencе
Of a Hollywood love affair
Waking up in the islands
Cause I saw you thеre
Lost and trying to be

I was just trying to be cool
I was just trying to be like you
I'm a spark and you're a boom
What am I supposed to do?

I drink but I choke
I love but I don't

Title: ​could cry just thinkin about you

Lyrics:
[Verse]
Now I'm knee-deep in this mess
I could cry just thinking about you
Every line I write is something about you
Every guy I want looks something just like you
Every book I read, I only read for you
Every art piece is just to remind you
I don't know who I am, with or without you
But I guess I'm 'bout to find out
I, I, I


Title: Crazy Love

I can hear her heart beat for a thousand miles
And the heavens open everytime she smiles
And when I come to her that's just where I belong
Yet I run into her like a river's song

[Chorus]
She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love

[Verse 2]
She's got a fine sеnse of humor when I'm feeling low down
And when I comе to her when the sun goes down
She takes away my trouble, takes away my grief, yeah, yeah
Takes away all of my heartache in the night like a thief

Yes, I need her in the daytime
But I need her in the night
Yes, I wanna throw my arms around you
And kiss and hug, and kiss and hug her tight

[Verse 3]
And when I'm returning from so far away
She gives me some sweet lovin', brighten up my day
Yes, it makes me righteous and it makes me feel whole
And it makes me feel mellow down to my soul

[Chorus + Outro]
She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love
Love, love, love, love, crazy love
She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love

Title: DANCING TILL THE END

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I've got you in the palm of my sweating hand
In the grip of a slipping man
Hanging on a string of confusion
And a hopeful illusion of my touch

[Pre-Chorus]
Here we are now, here we go again
Here despite how you're not here for amusement
Or getting lost in the movement

[Chorus]
I said I'm losing you
But we're dancing 'til the end
I know what's best to do
But the truth will just defend
I'll miss the way you move
And I know it's my demand
But if I'm losing you
Can we dance until the end?

[Verse 2]
You're in the arms of a hurricane
Of a storm that I can't explain
You say my heart is a nuisance
But I'm only a human, and my love

[Pre-Chorus]
Here we are now, here we go again
Here despite how you're not here for amusement
Or getting lost in the movement, yeah

[Chorus]
I said I'm losing you
But we're dancing 'til the end
I know what's best to do
But the truth will just defend
I'll miss the way you move
And I know it's my demand
But if I'm losing you
Can we dance until the end?

[Bridge]
(Ooh)
I said I'm losing you
(Ooh)
I'll miss the way you move
(Ooh)
I said I'm losing you
(Ooh)

[Chorus]
I said I'm losing you
But we're dancing 'til the end
I know what's best to do
But the truth will just defend
I'll miss the way you move (Oh, and I'll miss)
And I know it's my demand
But if I'm losing you (If I'm losing you)
Can we dance until the end?
I said I'm losing you
But we're dancing 'til the end
I know what's best to do
But the truth will just defend
I'll miss the way you move
(Oh, and I'll miss, oh, and I'll miss you)
And I know it's my demand
But if I'm losing you
Can we dance until the end?


Title: Dear Lord and Father of Mankind

Lyrics:
[Verse]
Dear Lord and Father of mankind
Forgive our foolish ways
Reclothe us in our rightful mind
In purer lives Thy service find
In deeper reverence, praise
In deeper reverence, praise
Breathe through the heats of our desire
Thy coolness and Thy balm
Let sense be dumb, let flesh retire
Speak through the earthquake, wind, and fire
O still, small voice of calm
O still, small voice of calm


Title: DKLA

Lyrics:
[Intro: Troye Sivan]
Wrapped my thoughts around your mind
Wrapped your body around mine

[Verse 1: Troye Sivan]
Play it back and press rewind
To when you traced your fingers, drew my spine
Lost its beat and so I find
I starve my heart of touch and time

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
So what do I do now?
I don't keep love around
So what do I do now?
I don't keep love around
What do I do now?
I don't keep love around, love around
Love around, love around

[Verse 2: Troye Sivan]
When we tried it, we were a fire with no smoke
Rags to riches but I'm addicted to being broke
You take my breath away, you know I'm bound to choke
When I close my eyes, I still see your ghost

[Chorus]
So what do I do now?
I don't keep love around
So what do I do now?
I don't keep love around
What do I do now?
I don't keep love around, love around
Love around, love around

[Bridge: Troye Sivan]
I don't keep love around, ye-eah
I don't keep love around, ooh yeah
I don't keep love around
Love around
Love around

[Verse 3: Tkay Maidza]
They can't stand, I handstand
Don't hold on right anymore
Pleased to meet you, I'm kinda moved
But that last one was my antidote
Green eyes, become green times
But there is no first or a last chance
They're telling me to turn down
'Cause I'm so lit, recall Flash Dance?
Only A1 and I stay 1
And I'm counting out for that day when
Residuals become imminent
'Cause failure is not pivotal
They just be asking the same
Try switch it up, I switch lanes
No love in this world, I’m still sane
Right? Because that's enough?
When the light on and you don't keep love

[Outro: Troye Sivan]
"Distance makes the heart grow fonder’"
Said by someone stronger than me
So what do I do now? Do now?
So what do I do now?
I don't keep love around anymore
I don't keep love around anymore
I don't keep, I don't keep
Love around


Title: EASE

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Troye Sivan]
I'm down to my skin and bone
And my mummy, she can't put down the phone
And stop asking how I'm doing all alone, alone
But the truth is the stars are falling, ma
And the wolves are out c-calling, ma
And my home has never felt this far

[Pre-Chorus: Troye Sivan & Georgia Nott]
But all this driving
Is driving me crazy
And all this moving
Is proving to get the best of me
And I've been trying to hide it
But lately
Every time I think I'm better
Pickin' my head up, getting nowhere

[Chorus: Troye Sivan & Georgia Nott]
Take me back to the basics and the simple life
Tell me all of the things that make you feel at ease
Your touch, my comfort, and my lullaby
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night

[Verse 2: Troye Sivan]
Now I'm down to my skin and bones
My baby listens to me on the phone
But I can't help feeling like I'm all alone, all alone
The truth is, the stars are falling, babe
And I'd never ever thought that I would say
I'm afraid of the life that I've made, I've made

[Pre-Chorus: Troye Sivan]
But all this driving
Is driving me crazy
And all this moving
Is proving to get the best of me
And I've been trying to hide it
But lately
Every time I think I'm better
Pickin' my head up, getting nowhere

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
Take me back to the basics and the simple life
Tell me all of the things that make you feel at ease
Your touch, my comfort, and my lullaby
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night

[Bridge: Georgia Nott]
I've been lyin' to them all
I don't need it anymore
Don't you worry about me
I'll be fine if I can breathe
I've been out here for too long
Taking shit for how I'm wrong
How I'm wrong
Always wrong

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
Take me back to the basics and the simple life
Tell me all of the things that make you feel at ease
Your touch, my comfort, and my lullaby
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night

[Outro: Troye Sivan]
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
(Take me back to the basics and the simple life)
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
(Tell me all of the things that make you feel at ease)
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
(Your touch, my comfort and my lullaby)
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night


Title: Easy

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
You ran away to find something to say
I went astray to make it okay
And he made it easy, darlin'
I'm still in love, and I say that because
I know how it seems between you and me
It hasn't been easy, darlin'

[Chorus]
I can't even look at you
Would you look at the space just next to your feet?
The wood is warping
The lines distorting
This house is on fire, woo!
Burning the tears right off my face
What the hell did we do?
Tell me we'll make it through

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause he made it easy, easy
Please, don't leave me, leave me (Easy)

[Verse 2]
What's left of the dance?
The smell on my hands
The rock in my throat, a hair on my coat
The stranger at home, my darling
(Like some kind of freak, my darling)
Now I'm vulnerable, so sad and alone
But don't cry for me, 'cause everyone knows
You reap what you sow, my darling
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I can't even look at you
Would you look at the space just next to your feet?
The wood is warping
The lines distorting
This house is on fire, woo!
Burning the tears right off my face
What the hell did we do?
Tell me we'll make it through

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause he made it easy, easy
Please, don't leave me, don't leave me

[Bridge]
He made it easy, please, don't leave me
He made it easy, please, don't leave me

[Chorus]
I can't even look at you
Would you look at the space just next to your feet?
The wood is warping
The lines distorting
This house is on fire, woo!
Burning the tears right off my face
What the hell did we do?
Tell me we'll make it through

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause he made it easy, easy
Please, don't leave me, no, don't leave me

[Outro]
He made it easy
Please, don't leave me
He made it easy
Please, don't leave me

Title: Fools

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I am tired of this place, I hope people change
I need time to replace what I gave away
And my hopes, they are high, I must keep them small
Though I try to resist I still want it all

[Pre-Chorus]
I see swimming pools and living rooms and aeroplanes
I see a little house on the hill and children's names
I see quiet nights poured over ice and Tanqueray
But everything is shattering and it's my mistake

[Chorus]
Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall
Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall

[Verse 2]
Oh, our lives don't collide, I'm aware of this
The differences and impulses and your obsession with
The little things you like stick, kinda like aerosol
I've tried my luck, I'm not giving up, I still want it all

Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall
Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall

I see swimming pools and living rooms and aeroplanes
I see a little house on the hill and children's names

Title: ​for him.

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Troye Sivan]
We are runnin' so fast
And we never look back
And whatever I lack
You make up
We make a really good team
And though not everyone sees
We got this crazy chemistry
Between us
Jump-starting your car 'cause this city's a bore
Buying e-cigarettes at the convenience store
Making new clichés on our own little tour
Let's ride

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
You don't have to say I love you to say I love you
Forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons
We've been making shades of purple out of red and blue
Sickeningly sweet like honey, don't need money
All I need is you
All I need is you, you

[Verse 2: Troye Sivan]
We try staying up late
But we both are lightweights
Yeah, we get off our face too easy
And we take jokes way too far
And sometimes living's too hard
We're like two halves of one heart

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
You don't have to say I love you to say I love you
Forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons
We've been making shades of purple out of red and blue
Sickeningly sweet like honey, don't need money
All I need is you
All I need is you, you

[Verse 3: Allday]
Eat a pill, stay and chill, you don't need to go
I'm about to bring emo back if you leave my home
I'd panic at the disco and you'd rather watch a TV show
Then I'll squeeze your booty real hard like I'm kneading dough
Pizza boy, I'm speeding for ya
We can get married tonight if you really wanna
Me in a cheap suit like a sleazy lawyer
And if you break this lil' heart, it'd be an honour

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
You don't have to say I love you to say I love you
Forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons
We've been making shades of purple out of red and blue
Sickeningly sweet like honey, don't need money
All I need is you
All I need is you, you


Title: Fun

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Well, don't you want to see the world, boy?
All the countries and their stars, boy
Just don't look them in the eyes, boy
You just gotta take their lives, boy
Let me take you for a drive, boy
Oh, I swear you'll feel alive, boy

[Pre-Chorus]
All you gotta do is trust that I'm being true
And do it for the people who love you

[Chorus]
Let's go have fun
You and me in the old jeep
Ridin' 'round town with our rifles on the front seat
Fun, you and me in the Middle East
Shootin' at rocks bullets cocked
In the mid-day sun
You and me in the old jeep
Ridin' 'round town with our rifles on the front seat
Fun, you and me in the Middle East
Shootin' at rocks bullets cocked
In the mid-day sun

[Post-Chorus]
Listen to what I tell you
You'll see, my son
Now you know what you gotta do
Let's go have fun

[Verse 2]
When you're standing on the line, boy
Don't go looking for goodbye, boy
Yeah, you gotta set them free, boy
'Cause you know that's what they need, boy
Yeah, you're gonna make them proud, boy
Till they put you in the ground, boy

[Pre-Chorus]
All you gotta do is trust that I'm being true
And do it for the people who love you

[Chorus]
Let's go have fun
You and me in the old jeep
Ridin' 'round town with our rifles on the front seat
Fun, you and me in the Middle East
Shootin' at rocks bullets cocked

Ridin' 'round town with our rifles on the front seat
Fun, you and me in the Middle East
Shootin' at rocks bullets cocked
In the mid-day sun

Fun, you and me in the Middle East
Shootin' at rocks bullets cocked

You and me in the old jeep

Title: Gasoline

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I smell heartbreak on my hands
I feel sick to my stomach as I begin to stand
I see your outline in my bed
In the same spot I watched him rest his head
I've done you wrong, I regret it
I write this song, tryna forget it
Feel this emptiness in my chest
I feel surreal but I'm feeling stressed
I need to do something
Fucked up for nothing
Oh, I gotta just tell someone
Tell someone what I've done

[Chorus]
Please bathe me now, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire
Like gasoline
Bathe me now, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire
Like gasoline
Oh no, like gasoline

[Verse 2]
Wake up the morning after
You call, but I don't answer
And I can't look you in the eye
No matter how hard I try
You deserve forever
Not a boy looking for better
But as long as you're still here
I will try to keep you near

[Chorus]
Please bathe me now, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire
Like gasoline
Bathe me now, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire
Like gasoline
Oh no, like gasoline
Please bathe me now, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire
Like gasoline
Bathe me now, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire
Like gasoline
Oh no, like gasoline


Title: Giving It All

Lyrics:
[Intro]
Here I am
This is me
Just a boy
Wait and see
I'm getting so close I can feel it
But I'm not quite there yet

[Verse]
As my life just begun
Is this as good as it gets?
Will I look back and remember?
Will I have no breath?
Am I still too young?
Am I too small to walk tall
I'm gonna leave all the menace behind me
Heal the sadness inside me
Look in the light and you'll find me
Giving it all
I'm giving it all


Title: Glittery (From The Kacey Musgraves Christmas Show)

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
You shake me up and turn me upside down
Just like a snow globe
And every time you touch me
I shiver right down to my toes
You got a strange effect on me
You know you make me feel so

[Chorus]
Glittery
You light me up like starlight on a Christmas tree
Every single kiss is like a gift to me
And I love the way you decorate my heart

[Verse 2]
Outside it's coming down
But here inside, it's warming up so
When you take your time
You turn me on and make my life glow
You got a strange effect on me
You make me feel so

[Chorus]
Glittery
You light me up like starlight on a Christmas tree
Every single kiss is like a gift to me
And I love the way you decorate my heart

[Bridge]
The winter is so gray, feels like the ice is here to stay
But when you look at me, you know you melt it all away

[Chorus]
Every single kiss is like a gift to me
And I love the way you decorate my heart
Oh, so glittery
I love the way you decorate my heart


Title: #Goals

Lyrics:
[Verse]
Body in The Hamptons
Thirty two karat gold mask on my face
And the horizon down in Costa Rica

[Pre-Chorus]
I just want a taste of the champagne at the Gods
Like to drink on my days off
Like a bronze Kardashian

[Chorus]
These are my goals, leave me alone
Sippin' Patron in the back of my Rolls-Royce
Me and my goals, shippin' I out
A body like "Whoa" on the front of the tabloids

[Post-Chorus]
These are my goals, whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
These are my goals, whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
These are my goals, leave me alone
Sippin' Patron in the back of my Rolls-Royce
Me and my goals, shippin' I out
A body like "Whoa" on the front of the tabloids

[Post-Chorus]
Thеse are my goals, whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
Thesе are my goals, whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh

Title: Happy Little Pill

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
In the crowd, alone
And every second passing
Reminds me I'm not home
Bright lights and city sounds
Are ringing like a drone
Unknown, unknown

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, glazed eyes, empty hearts
Buying happy from shopping carts
Nothing but time to kill
Sipping life from bottles
Tight skin, bodyguards
Gucci down the boulevard

Take me away
Dry my eyes
Bring colour to my skies
My sweet little pill
Take my hunger
Lie within
Numb my skin

Sweat and conversations
Seep into my bone
Four walls are not enough
I'll take a dip into
The unknown, unknown

Buying happy from shopping carts
Nothing but time to kill
Sipping life from bottles
Tight skin, bodyguards
Gucci down the boulevard

Take me away
Dry my eyes
Bring colour to my skies
My sweet little pill
Take my hunger
Lie within
Numb my skin

Take me away
Dry my eyes
Bring colour to my skies
My sweet little pill
Take my hunger

Numb my skin


Title: HEAVEN

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Troye Sivan]
The truth runs wild
Like a tear down a cheek
Trying to save face, and daddy heart break
I'm lying through my teeth
This voice inside
Has been eating at me
Trying to replace the love that I fake
With what we both need
The truth runs wild
Like kids on concrete
Trying to sedate, my mind in its cage
And numb what I see
Awake, wide eyed
I'm screaming at me
Trying to keep faith and picture his face
Staring up at me

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
Without losing a piece of me
How do I get to heaven?
Without changing a part of me
How do I get to heaven?
All my time is wasted
Feeling like my heart's mistaken, oh
So if I'm losing a piece of me
Maybe I don't want heaven?

[Verse 2: Betty Who]
The truth runs wild
Like the rain to the sea
Trying to set straight the lines that I trace
To find some relief
This voice inside
Has been eating at me
Trying to embrace the picture I paint
And colour me free

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
Without losing a piece of me
How do I get to heaven?
Without changing a part of me
How do I get to heaven?
All my time is wasted
Feeling like my heart's mistaken, oh
So if I'm losing a piece of me
Maybe I don't want heaven?

[Bridge: Troye Sivan]
So I'm counting to fifteen
Counting to fifteen, counting to fifteen
So I'm counting to fifteen
Counting to fifteen, counting to fifteen
So I'm counting to fifteen
Counting to fifteen, counting to fifteen
So I'm counting to fifteen
Counting to fifteen, counting to fifteen

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
Without losing a piece of me
How do I get to heaven?
Without changing a part of me
How do I get to heaven?
All my time is wasted
Feeling like my heart's mistaken, oh
So if I'm losing a piece of me
Maybe I don't want heaven?

[Outro: Troye Sivan]
The truth runs wild
Like a tear down a cheek


Title: Hologram Hearts

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I'd rather kiss the air than touch your skin
'Cause I don't wanna see what lies within
You're a constellation giving light
Something in me wants to read your shine

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's cease fire for a little while
Sandpaper over sheets
And just lie like a poster child
Turn the other cheek

[Chorus]
Hologram hearts still break, ah-ah-ah
Living in a silken cage, ah-ah-ah
'Cause I know I’m not that pretty
And I'm taking your heart with me
And I'm not coming home
Hologram hearts still break, ah-ah-ah-ah

[Verse 2]
I wanna find a place where you belong
Somewhere real nice where you're comfortable
I wanna fuck around, is that so wrong?
You're a puppet on my hands, string you along

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's cease fire for a little while
Sandpaper over sheets
And just lie like a poster child
Turn the other cheek

[Chorus]
Hologram hearts still break, ah-ah-ah
Life in a silken cage, ah-ah-ah
'Cause I know I’m not that pretty
And I'm taking your heart with me
And I'm not coming home
Hologram hearts still break, ah-ah-ah-ah

[Bridge]
I don't wanna talk about the me and your reflection
'Cause when I saw with you, it's just a part of my projection
I don't wanna talk about the me and your reflection
'Cause when I saw with you, it's just a part of my projection

[Chorus]
Hologram hearts still break, ah-ah-ah
Life in a silken cage, ah-ah-ah
'Cause I know I’m not that pretty
And I'm taking your heart with me
And I'm not coming home
Hologram hearts still break, ah-ah-ah-ah


Title: Honey

Lyrics:
[Chorus]
Give me the courage to say all the shit I mean, yeah
Give me a song to rock your body, a lucid dream, yeah
I don't know how I'm gonna tell you what you really mean, yeah
Give me that honey, honey, love, you've got the recipe

[Verse 1]
You know
I see love in every space
I see sex in every city, every town
I wonder what us two could make
'Cause I feel so good around you
Can you imagine what we'd get up to? Yeah
There's something different about tonight
I could speak, or just let my body explain
I'm getting close to satisfied
And I've learned so much about you
Don't know your name, that's something we'll get to, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Overdrive
My body's workin' in overdrive
Don't care how late, let's go overtime
Mantra, eternally in my mind
In my mind

Give me that honey, honey, love, you've got the recipe

[Verse 2]
I don't pray a lot, God knows
But I'm callin' in favours like I believe
Don't go bringin' me that close
'Cause I feel so good around you
I'm going in tonight like I love you, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Overdrive
My body's workin' in overdrive
Don't care how late, let's go overtime
Mantra, eternally in my mind
In my mind

Title: How To Stay With You

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Cut my garden down
I've got no flowers, but it's the thought that counts
Wish you lived a little closer
Maybe when we're a little older
We can set up shop, ah
Back where you are or I can take you home
I feel like my brother might like you
Just not in the same way I do, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Boy, I wish you were the piece
To get me out the game
If I have to say what I mean
Is it fair to say?
All of these visions
Impair my decisions
And I can't stop

[Chorus]
I'm a little bit fucked on this
I'm a littlе bit out of time to spend with you
Baby, turn around, give mе one more kiss
I'm a little bit lost on how to stay with you

[Verse 2]
I turn my bussy out
It's been a sec, but I didn't forget
How to pull you in closer
In case it's not till we're older
That we reach the top
The pinnacle of everything we are
I feel like my mother might like you
Just not in the same way I do

[Pre-Chorus]
Boy, I wish you were the piece
To get me out the game
If I have to say what I mean
Is it fair to say?
All of these visions impair my decisions
And I can't stop

[Chorus]
I'm a little bit fucked on this
I'm a little bit out of time to spend with you
Baby, turn around, give me one more kiss
I'm a little bit lost on how to stay with you, yeah

[Outro]
Startin' again when I got all I wanted
Startin' to feel a little bit despondent, yeah
Yeah
Startin' again when I got all I wanted
Startin' to feel a little bit despondent


Title: How Troye Sivan Broke Free

Lyrics:
“Can I ride this wearing high heels?” Troye Sivan asks, eyeing a scooter suspiciously. The high heels in question are raising his pointy black Helmut Lang boots about two inches off the ground – “I’m not sure if they’re men’s or women’s” – and the scooter is the popular new motorized kind that you unlock with a smartphone app. Sivan steps aboard, kicks off and lurches forward. Another question occurs to him: “How do you stop it?”

It’s mid-June and Sivan, a 23-year-old pop phenomenon, is in search of a good coffee on the west side of Los Angeles, the city he currently calls home. He’s got an excellent new album on the way, Bloom; a new single, “Dance to This,” featuring Ariana Grande, which premiered this morning; and a photo shoot this afternoon. But he’s learned to carve out downtime for himself, and so this morning, after he woke up around 7 a.m. at the hillside house he shares with his boyfriend – a model and photographer named Jacob Bixenman – he hit his pool for a soak. He pointedly did not bring his phone in. “I try not to use it for the first hour of the day,” he says. “My parents were like, ‘Don’t get on your phone first thing. Use your pool more.’ ”

Many of us claim various degrees of dependence on technology, but Sivan wouldn’t be who he is today without it. Born in Johannesburg and raised in the Australian coastal city of Perth, he rose to prominence as a teenage YouTube star – posting song covers at first, then charismatic straight-to-camera monologues that ranged from the comedic to the diaristic. When he knew he was gay, around 14, social media proved indispensable to shaping his identity – albeit anonymously at first: “I’d go to YouTube, put on private browsing and watch one coming-out video after the next.” He also hung out in queer forums under a pseudonym; later, he lied about his age and joined Grindr. (“I met one guy through there, and it wasn’t, like, a hookup — it was a date,” he notes.) Later, after coming out to his parents and siblings, who were supportive, he got a fake ID and met some older guys at bars – a “period of self-discovery” and occasional “uncomfortable situations” that he sings about on the Bloom opener, “Seventeen.” But it was the virtual realm where he truly grew into his skin as a young gay man; in 2013 he posted his own “coming out” video, which has nearly 8 million views. “I’m so thankful I had the Internet,” he says.



Sivan has blue eyes, dyed-blonde hair and a little hoop nose ring. In conversation he’s ruminative; on a scooter he’s cautious bordering on mercenary. As we approach a steep downhill he slows to let me lead: “You go first.” At the bottom we roll into an intersection and, halfway across, our motors unexpectedly stall. “Did yours die, too?” Sivan asks. We haul them awkwardly to the curb, before the light changes: it turns out we’ve gotten too far out of range from Sivan’s management team, who unlocked the scooters using their phones.

He tells me about Bloom as we walk the rest of the way. It’s the follow-up to his Top 10 debut, 2015’s Blue Neighbourhood. “I wasn’t really sure what I was doing on that one, and it kind of came together song by song,” he says. “It was a coming-of-age record, whereas Bloom was written after finishing a tour, during the period of finding a house, being really happy in my relationship and figuring out so much about myself. I was going out a lot, hearing music I’d never heard, going to queer spaces where you feel completely free to do whatever you want; where, for the first time, you don’t feel like the minority.” The result is a self-assured 10-song set that swings from uptempo electronic tracks to strummed acoustic ballads like “The Good Side.” Frank Ocean is one of Sivan’s cited influences; so are the Replacements, Francis and the Lights, Kate Bush and Cocteau Twins. He chose the digital clap sound on one Bloom song because, in its evocation of classic Madonna, it struck him as sounding appealingly “gay.”


Soon Sivan will head out on a theater tour, so he’s been taking dance lessons to get more comfortable onstage: “We spent the whole first class just moving in slow motion for, like, two hours.” He’s got reason to be optimistic, though. When we get to a cafe, Sivan orders an iced latte and receives a text from Grande, sharing good news about their new song’s performance on iTunes. Sivan shows me his phone and beams: “She just texted me, ‘Top 10, ho.’ ”


Title: ​idk if I’m awake anymore

Lyrics:
I can't really tell if I'm awake anymore.
The líne between dream, reality, and nightmare has become so blurred.
I could cry just thinking about you.
I don't really know who I am anymore, with or without you.
But I guess I'm about to find out.


Title: I Hear Gods

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Claudia Kane]
I hear gods, they'll [?] all for you
I hear gods, they fight an epic fight for you
I hear gods, their hearts break as they lose sight of you
I hear gods, I hear gods

[Pre-Chorus: Troye Sivan]
Everyday, I'm looking for you and
Every night, I'm searching for truth
I'm not seeing it anywhere
I'm not seeing it anywhere
I'm not seeing it anywhere
I'm not backing down into it
Woah-oh, but I hear gods

[Chorus: Troye Sivan and Claudia Kane]

But I can't love what I can't understand

[Verse 2: Claudia Kane]
I'll part [?] so you can find your way through
I'll make wars if nations will not follow you
I'll bring storms if they don't wanna love you like I do
I'll bring storms, I'll bring storms

[Pre-Chorus: Troye Sivan]
Everyday, I'm looking for you and
Every night, I'm searching for truth
I'm not seeing it anywhere
I'm not seeing it anywhere
I'm not seeing it anywhere
I'm not backing down into it
Woah-oh, but I hear gods

[Chorus: Troye Sivan and Claudia Kane]
(I just wanna love you)
I hear gods
(But I can't keep [?])

Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, woah
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, woah

[Verse 1: Armani Adames]
Party, trying my best to meet somebody
But everybody around me is falling in love to our song
I, I, oh I, yeah
Hate it, taking a shot 'cause I can't take it
But I don't think that they make anything that strong, so I hold on
I, I, oh I, yeah

[Chorus: Armani Adames]
I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, woah
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, woah

[Verse 2: David Diaz]
Strangers, killing my lonely nights with strangers
And when they leave, I go back to our song, I hold on
I, I, oh I
Hurts like heaven, lost in the sound
Buzzcut Season like you're still around
Can't unmiss you, and I need you now
Yeah, I, I, oh I, oh yeah

[Chorus: Armani Adames & David Diaz]
I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, woah
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, woah
I'm so tired of love songs (Someone take me home)
Just wanna go home ('Cause I can't be alone)(Mmm)
I'm so tired of love songs (I'm so tired)(Mmm)
Tired of love, tired of love
Tired of love, tired of love


Title: IN A DREAM

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I think about it
Can't think about it
Took a flight all the way home, yeah, ooh
No way around it, I still see you way up here, yeah
I'm stressed about it
Went west about it
Took a hammer to my phone, yeah, ooh
No way around it; I still hear you crystal clear

[Pre-Chorus]
But I won't let you in again
I'm gonna lock the doors and hide my shit
'Cause my spirit's wearing thin
And there's only so much I can give
I won't let you in again
That's the hardest thing I've ever said, you know
It's the hardest thing I've said

[Chorus]
Guess I might understand it
If you don't listen to me
Would've thought it was obvious
That you don't show up in a dream
Guess I even forgive you
For you not wanting to leave, no, no, no
Put my shoes on and run away
But you still show up in a dream
Only making this harder
'Cause I still have to see your, see your face, yeah
(Ooh, ooh)

[Verse 2]
Can you come back?
Wait, I don't mean that, no
It's all just feeling real now (Ooh)
So far away, but I still feel you everywhere

[Pre-Chorus]
But I can't let you in again
I'm gonna lock the doors and hide my shit (Hide my shit)
'Cause my spirit's wearing thin
And there's only so much I can give (I can give)
I won't let you in again
That's the hardest thing I've ever said, you know
That's the hardest thing I've said

[Chorus]
Guess I might understand it
If you don't listen to me
Would've thought it was obvious
That you don't show up in a dream
Guess I even forgive you
For you not wanting to leave, no, no, no
Put my shoes on and run away
But you still show up in a dream
Only making this harder
'Cause I still have to see your, see your face, yeah
(Ooh, ooh)

[Bridge]
But I can't let you in again
I'm gonna lock the doors and hide my shit
'Cause my spirit's wearing thin
And there's only so much I can give
I won't let you in again
That's the hardest thing I've ever said, you know
That's the hardest thing I've said

[Chorus]
Guess I might understand it
If you don't listen to me
Would've thought it was obvious
That you don't show up in a dream
Guess I even forgive you
For you not wanting to leave, no, no, no
Put my shoes on and run away
But you still show up in a dream
Only making this harder
'Cause I still have to see your, see your face, yeah
(Ooh, ooh)


Title: In My Room

Lyrics:
[Chorus: Guitarricadelafuente, Troye Sivan]
Confundo la realidad
Y es que todo me extasía
Se ha encendido el cielo
Se te enreda el pelo
Tus espuelas con las mías
So in my head
And I leave it like an unmade bed
Oh, I don't wanna clean up yet
Keep it messy, messy, messy, oh, yeah
Se ha encendido el cielo
Se te enreda el pelo
Tus espuelas con las mías

Am I fucking sixteen?
This shit's kinda depressin'
All you're doin' to me
'Cause you mess me, test me, wreck me, oh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Troye Sivan]
Maybe it's just admiration, copulation, or
Adoration, no defence, infatuation, oh, yeah
I'm all alone in my room
I'm just thinkin' 'bout you
It's a feeling I can't describe
Maybe it's just admiration, copulation, or
Adoration, no defence, infatuation, oh, yeah

[Verse 2: Guitarricadelafuente, Troye Sivan]

Tu mirada es genuina
Sé que estás pensando
Carnavaleando
Has dado en el blanco
Dientes en el canto
Que la carne fría
Es fina peletería (Oh, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Troye Sivan]
I'm all alone in my room

Title: Just One Minute

Lyrics:
[Verse: Veronique Lalouette, Troye Sivan]
All it took
Was a second
Was a moment in your eyes
In a glance
How you beckoned
Now I've come to realise

[Chorus: Troye Sivan, Veronique Lalouette, Both]
Why don't we run away?
Why don't we run away?
I need just one minute alone with you
And the world would stop in a single moment
Just one minute alone with you
Feel the pressure drop as my heart's up on it
Just to feel you
Just to hold you close
For a minute—
For a minute—

[Spoken]
Goddamn, his voice's breaking

They say, "You think you're so damn cool

Don't be surprised if you don't last the year"

Title: Kid Wonder

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I can change your life in a single night
I can make you hungry, get an appetite
I could tell a story that would make you cry
But nobody ever seems to bat an eye

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause this town's too small for a girl like me
(For a girl like me, for a girl like me)
It feels like I'm a walking tragedy
(Walking tragedy, walking tragedy)

[Chorus]
But do you ever wonder about the kid wonder?
If only you knew it was me
I'm the kid wonder
And do you ever wonder about the kid wonder?
If only you knew it was me
I'm the kid wonder

[Verse 2]
I give you a ticket to the midnight show
We can hit the road and we can go, go, go
Turn our faces in and you can kiss me slow
I can turn around and say I told you so

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause this town's too small for a girl like me
(For a girl like me, for a girl like me)
It feels like I'm a walking tragedy
(Walking tragedy, walking tragedy)

But do you ever wonder about the kid wonder?
If only you knew it was me
I'm the kid wonder
And do you ever wonder about the kid wonder?
If only you knew it was me
I'm the kid wonder

Title: LOST BOY

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
As the smile fell from your face, I fell with it
Our faces blue
There's a heart stain on the carpet
I left it, I left it with you
Yeah, the truth is that I'm sorry
Though I told you not to worry
I'm just some dumb kid
Trying to kid myself
That I got my shit together
So go, get to runnin', won't you hurry?
While it's light out, while it's early
Before I start to miss any part of this
And change my mind, whatever

[Chorus]
I say I wanna settle down
Build your hopes up like a tower
I'm giving you the run-around
I'm just a lost boy
Not ready to be found
Not ready to be found
I'm just a lost boy
Not ready to be found

[Verse 2]
I don't care much for locks on the window
To keep me at bay
I'll leave you one last kiss on your pillow
Before I fly away
Yeah, we knew from the beginning
That this wasn't never ending
Shouldn't stay too long
'Cause we're both too young
To give into forever

[Chorus]
I say I wanna settle down
Build your hopes up like a tower
I'm giving you the run-around
I'm just a lost boy
Not ready to be found
Not ready to be found
I'm just a lost boy

[Bridge]
So what are you waiting for?
'Cause someone could love you more
I'm just a lost boy, lost boy
So what are you waiting for?
'Cause someone could love you more
I'm just a lost boy, lost boy
So what are you waiting for?
'Cause someone could love you more
I'm just a lost boy, lost boy
So what are you waiting for?
'Cause someone could love you more
I'm just a lost boy, lost boy

[Chorus]
I say I wanna settle down
Build your hopes up like a tower
I'm giving you the run-around
I'm just a lost boy
Not ready to be found
Not ready to be found
I'm just a lost boy
Not ready to be found


Title: Love Is A Losing Game

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
For you, I was a flame
Love is a losing game
Five-story fire as you came
Love is a losing game
One I wished I never played
What a mess we made
Now the final frame
Love is a losing game

[Verse 2]
Played out by the band
Love is a losing hand
More than I could stand
Love is a losing hand
Self-professed, profound
'Til the chips were down
Know you're a gambling man
Love is a losing hand

[Verse 3]
Though I battle blind
Love is a fate resigned
Memories mar my mind
Love is a fate rеsigned
Over futile odds
And laughеd at by the gods
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game

You didn't know I was listening
But I was there, sitting on the stairs
Talk about me in the kitchen
You didn't know I was listening
But I was there, and that isn't fair

[Chorus: Allie X & Troye Sivan, Troye Sivan]
Wrong
Yeah, you love me wrong

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I heard of
Once in a lullaby

[Verse 2]
Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true

[Bridge]
Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true

[Outro]
If happy little bluebirds fly
Beyond the rainbow
Why, oh, why can't I?


Title: Papercut

[Verse 1: Troye Sivan]
Now we're staring at the ceiling, you're so pretty when you're mad
All that I can hear is breathing, oh, oh
And we're stuck inside the silence, in a cold, cold war
We're too proud to say we're sorry, oh, oh
[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
Right now it feels like we're bleeding
So deep that we might not get back up
Our words, they tear through the surface
Like a paper, like a paper cut
Right now, don't know why I love you
But by the morning, when we wake up
I'll reach for you and remember
It was just a paper, just a paper cut

[Verse 2: Troye Sivan]
I find refuge in the distance, even when we're breaking down
Can we pause it just for one kiss? Oh, oh
Cause I never meant to hurt you, and I know you feel the same
Still the only one I run to, oh, oh

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
Right now it feels like we're bleeding
So deep that we might not get back up
Our words, they tear through the surface
Like a paper, like a paper cut
Right now, don't know why I love you
But by the morning, when we wake up
I'll reach for you and remember
It was just a paper, just a paper cut

[Interlude]

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
Right now it feels like we're bleeding
So deep that we might not get back up
Our words, they tear through the surface
Like a paper, like a paper cut
Right now, don't know why I love you
But by the morning, when we wake up
I'll reach for you and remember
It was just a paper, just a paper cut
Just a paper, just a paper cut
Just a paper, just a paper cut
Just a paper, just a paper cut


Title: Perfect

Lyrics:
[Intro]
Da-da, da-da-da
Da-da-da, da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da (BroZone)
Da-da-da, da-da-da

[Verse 1: All, Daveed Diggs, Troye Sivan, Eric Andre & Kid Cudi]
Well, there she goes
On the floor, let's do it
No more talkin' (No more talkin'), huh-uh
Did anybody notice?
The energy just shifted when we dropped that
Ooh, let it drop in (Let it drop in), ooh
I don't flex, but I might
Groove about to take flight?
'Cause the night is young and the music's on
And we got love on sight

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
The sky was the limit
Now, the stars where we're livin'
It's the vibe when we're in it
It'll blow your mind

[Chorus: All, Justin Timberlake]
It's so perfect, pеrfect, perfect
A hundrеd percent
Put us together, you know what you'll get
Yeah, it's so perfect, perfect, perfect
Harmony's so gold
And you'll never, ever wanna let it go
Ooh

[Verse 2: Troye Sivan/Kid Cudi]
They keep on watchin' us, watchin' us
We don't pay them no mind (We don't pay them no mind, no mind, no mind)
There ain't no stoppin', no stoppin'
If we ain't pressin' rewind (Rewind, rewind)

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
And the sky was the limit
Now, the stars where we're livin'
It's the vibe when we're in it
It'll blow your mind

[Chorus: All, Justin Timberlake]
It's so perfect, perfect, perfect
A hundred percent
Put us together, you know what you'll get
Yeah, it's so perfect, perfect, perfect
Harmony's so gold
And you'll never, ever wanna let it go
Don't let it go

[Bridge: Daveed Diggs]
I don't flex, but I might
Groove about to take flight?
'Cause the night is young and the music's on
And we got love on sight
Yeah, I don't flex, but I will
I ain't lacked the skills
'Cause when I do my dance, you put up your hands
Yeah, you can't buy these thrills

[Chorus: All, Justin Timberlake]
It's so perfect, perfect, perfect
A hundred percent
Put us together, you know what you'll get
Yeah, it's so perfect, perfect, perfect
Harmony's so gold
And you'll never, ever wanna let it go (Let it go)
Ooh
Perfect, perfect, perfect


Title: Plum

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Watching you sleep
Run my hands through your hair and it's got me thinking
What you mean to me
There's a chill in the air and a sinking feeling

[Pre-Chorus]
Coming over me
Like bitter tangerine
Like sirens in the streets
Oh, now

[Chorus]
Maybe our time has come
Maybe we're overgrown
Even the sweetest plum
Has only got so long
Baby, we're barely holding, holding on, oh
Even the sweetest plum
Has only got so long

[Verse 2]
Jealous, you can sleep
You've been keeping me up and I mouth the words
I think I wanna speak
Instead, I’m wasting my time just pressing rewind

[Pre-Chorus]
To all the nights we shared
The ripest peach or pear
But change is in the air, oh

[Chorus]
Maybe our time has come
Maybe we're overgrown
Even the sweetest plum
Has only got so long
Baby, we're barely holding, holding on, oh
Even the sweetest plum
Has only got so long
(Got so long)

[Bridge]
I was summer, you were spring
You can't change what the seasons bring
Yeah, I was summer and you were spring
You can't change what the seasons bring

[Chorus]
Maybe our time has come
Maybe we're overgrown
Even the sweetest plum
Has only got so long
Baby, we're barely holding, holding on, oh
Even the sweetest plum
Has only got so long

[Outro]
Maybe we're overgrown
The sweetest plum
Got so long (Got so long)
The sweetest plum
Has only got so long

You didn't give a fuck

[Pre-Chorus: Troye Sivan]
'Cause I don't sleep like your body's on me

Title: Pumped Up Kicks

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Robert's got a quick hand
He'll look around the room, he won't tell you his plan
He's got a rolled cigarette, ayy
Hanging out his mouth, he's a cowboy kid
He found a six-shooter gun
In his dad's closet with a box of fun things
I don't even know what
But he's coming for you, yeah, he's coming for you, wait

[Chorus]
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run faster than my bullet

[Verse 2]
Daddy works a long day
He's coming home late, and he's coming home late
He's bringing me a surprise
'Cause dinner's in the kitchen and it's packed in ice
I waited for a long time
The sleight of my hand is now a quick-pull trigger
I reason with my cigarette
They say, "Your hair's on fire, you must've lost your wits"

[Chorus]
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run faster than my bullet


Title: Rager teenager!

Hey, you
Where you been hanging out lately? (You)
Sleeping and spending nights, wasting time
Never thought I'd see you again in my life
Why you been acting like a stranger?
Feelin' alive, a teenager, ooh
Feels kinda cool in the rager and I
Never thought I'd see the day in my life
Yet here you are

I just wanna go wild
I just wanna fuck shit up and just ride
In your car tonight
In your bed tonight
I just wanna sing loud
I just wanna lose myself in a crowd
In your arms tonight
Or in his arms tonight

Title: Revelation

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Troye Sivan]
You're a revelation
Won't you liberate me now?
From a holy bound
You're a revolution
I will liberate you now
As the walls come down

[Pre-Chorus: Troye Sivan]
It's a rocky road
To say "Maybe I won't go"
Hey dear, you're a wrecking ball
And you’re here crushing all I'm told

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
Ever I roam
Ever I roam
Further from home
Your hand I know, now

[Verse 2: Troye Sivan]
It’s a revelation
There's no hell in what I've found
And no kingdom shout
How the tides are changing
As you liberate me now
And the walls come down

Til' the end
It's a rocky road
To say "Maybe I won't go"
Hey dear, you're a wrecking ball
And you’re here crushing all I'm told

Ever I roam
Ever I roam
Further from home
Your hand I know

Title: Running Shoes

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I'll keep wearing these running shoes 'til I'm all worn out
And they're no use to me
No use to me
Gunning for a peace from this abuse
'Cause I'm all tired out and I'm no use to you
No use to you

[Pre-Chorus]
And there's no rest for the wicked
So I'm screaming and I'm kicking to sleep
To sleep
The beliefs they're instilling
On the boys, on the children
On me, on me

[Chorus]
I've been running, I've been running for a while
For a while
I've been running, I've been running for a while
For a while

[Post-Chorus]
These running shoes weigh me down
These running shoes are wearing out
This running

[Verse 2]
Carved his name in the carpet
Right where I spent all of my sleepless nights in that room
In that room
Can't get his face out of my mind
And God knows that I've tried and tried for you

[Pre-Chorus]
And there's no rest for the wicked
So I'm screaming and I'm kicking to sleep
To sleep
The beliefs they're instilling
On the boys, on the children
On me, on me

[Chorus]
I've been running, I've been running for a while
(Running, running)
For a while
(Running, running)
I've been running, I've been running for a while
(Running, running)
For a while
(Running, running)

[Post-Chorus]
These running shoes weigh me down
(I've been running, I've been running for a while)
These running shoes are wearing out
This running
These running shoes weigh me down
(I've been running, I've been running for a while)
These running shoes are wearing out
This running
These running shoes weigh me down

[Bridge]
Love in America, got me down
Try take off running but hit the ground
(I hit the ground)

[Post-Chorus]
These running shoes weigh me down
(I've been running, I've been running for a while)
These running shoes are wearing out
This running
These running shoes weigh me down
(I've been running, I've been running for a while)
These running shoes are wearing out
This running
These running shoes weigh me down


Title: Rush

Lyrics:
[Intro: PinkPantheress]
I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch
Yeah

[Verse 1: Troye Sivan]
Big communication, tell me what you want
Translate your vibration, let your body talk to me
Baby love, if you wanna show me what
You've been schemin' up, if you wanna (Let go)
Trust the simulation, don't you let it break
Every stimulation, promise I can take
What you wanna give? Boy, you better show me what

My body blazin'

So good when we slow gravity, so good
It's so good, it's so good
Breathe, one, two, three, take all of me, so good
It's so good, it's so good

[Verse 2: PinkPantheress, PinkPantheress & Troye Sivan]
I know you're somebody interested in dancin'
I just told my lover, "Baby, tell me" (Yeah)
"Did you really care I two-stepped with another?"
But you're still my sunshine, take this with me
And I finished it so I know I'm sure
Haven't done this since September
Right around then you were at my door
I can barely still remember
How'd we end up on the floor?
Can we go some more?
Somehow I think we're better off just dancin'

[Pre-Chorus: HYUNJIN, PinkPantheress & Troye Sivan]
You got my heartbeat (Heartbeat) racin' (Racin')
My body blazin'

[Chorus: Troye Sivan & HYUNJIN]
I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch
Oh, I feel the rush
It's so good, it's so good
I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch
Oh, I feel the rush
It's so good, it's so good

[Post-Chorus: Troye Sivan, Troye Sivan & PinkPantheress, HYUNJIN]
So good when we slow gravity, so good
It's so good, it's so good (Good)
Breathe one, two, three, take all of me, so good
It's so good, it's so good

[Outro: HYUNJIN, PinkPantheress & Troye Sivan]
It's so good, it's so good
Yeah
It's so good, it's so good

Title: Seventeen

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I got these beliefs that I think you wanna break
Got something here to lose that I think you wanna take from me
You say that I'm asleep, but I wanna be awake
Got something here to lose that I know you wanna take

[Pre-Chorus]
And he said age is just a number, just like any other
We can do whatever, do whatever you want
Boy becomes a man now
Can't tell a man to slow down
He'll just do whatever, do whatever he wants

[Chorus]
I went out looking for love when I was seventeen
Maybe a little too young, but it was real to me
And in the heat of the night, saw things I'd never seen
No-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, seventeen

[Verse 2]
You should know I'm green, but I'll find my way around
Heard the whispers, now let's see what all the talk's about
I'm taking in the sights and measuring the sounds
Heard the whispers, now let's see what all the talk's about

[Pre-Chorus]
And he said age is just a number, just like any other
We can do whatever, do whatever you want
Boy becomes a man now
Can't tell a man to slow down
He'll just do whatever, do whatever he wants

[Chorus]
I went out looking for love when I was seventeen
Maybe a little too young, but it was real to me
And in the heat of the night, saw things I'd never seen
No-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, seventeen

[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, seventeen
Seventeen, seventeen, seventeen
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, seventeen
Seventeen, seventeen, seventeen

[Chorus]
I went out looking for love when I was seventeen
Maybe a little too young, but it was real to me
And in the heat of the night, saw things I'd never seen
No-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, seventeen
I went out looking for love when I was seventeen
Maybe a little too young, but it was real to me
And in the heat of the night, saw things I'd never seen
No-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, seventeen

Seventeen, seventeen, seventeen
Seventeen, seventeen, seventeen


Title: She’s 22

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
She's 22 and she's loving you
And you'll never know that it makes me blue
Does she make you happy?
I'm holding on to everything that's wrong
Cause we don't belong, you like my songs
And it makes me happy
Does she make you happy?

[Refrain]
You can throw away every word I say

[Verse 2]
I'm standing still on this hidden hill
And I'm looking around for the right way down
To your distant valley
Your flowers grow in the frozen snow
And I'd like to know, is it all a show?
Are you really happy? Are you really happy?

[Refrain]
Cause you can throw away every word I say
You just throw away

All the bodies on the floor collide
Everybody's out here lookin' right
The party's the only place that really knows me

Don't need anybody here to console me

Title: Somebody to Love

Lyrics:
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?

[Verse 1]
Each morning I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
Take a look in the mirror and cry
Lord what you're doing to me
I spent all my years in believing you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord

[Chorus]
Somebody
Ooh somebody
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?

[Verse 2]
I work hard
Every day of my life
I work til' I ache in my bones
At the end of the day
I take home my hard-earned pay all on my own
I get down on my knees
And I start to pray
Til' the tears run down from my eyes, Lord

[Chorus]
Somebody
Ooh somebody
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?

Find me somebody to love

Title: Somebody to Love Me

Lyrics:
[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
I don't wanna see you go
I want somebody to love me
Why'd it take so long to know?
I want somebody to love me
I want somebody to be nice
See the boy that I once was in my eyes
Nobody's gonna save my life
(Hey, hey, hey go!)

Ladies and gentleman
Dua Lipa!

[Verse 1: Dua Lipa]
We are wicked men
Looking for buckles to loosen
By the Count of 10
I wanna see somebody human
And I lost what it was
In the clear blue dust
Of a Downtown Romeo
In a couple of weeks
You can tell all the freaks
How you carried my body home

[Pre-Chorus: Troye Sivan]
But tonight I crossed the line
Dear Mr. Lonely
How much could you know me?
I could find lessons in light
But once you've earned it
You've already burned it

[Chorus: Dua Lipa, Troye Sivan]
I don't wanna see you go
I want somebody to love me
(Need somebody oh)
Why'd it take so long to know?
I want somebody to love me
(Need somebody oh)
I want somebody to be nice
See the boy that I once was in my eyes
Nobody's gonna save my life
Woo!

[Verse 2: Troye Sivan, Dua Lipa]
Got my ticket man and I'm looking
For somebody to use it
I know we pretend
But one of these days
We're gonna lose it
And I once left town
When the leaves turned brown
With a couple of souvenirs
She was in my car
When we hit that wall
Yeah it could've move me to tears

[Pre-Chorus: Troye Sivan]
But tonight I crossed the line
I used to know her
When my house was sober
I could find lessons in light
But once it's over, it's all really over

[Chorus: Dua Lipa, Troye Sivan]
I don't wanna see you go
I want somebody to love me
(Need somebody oh)
Why'd it take so long to know?
I want somebody to love me
(Need somebody oh)
I want somebody to be nice
See the boy that I once was in my eyes
Nobody's gonna save my life
(Hey, hey, hey!)

[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa, with Troye Sivan, Troye Sivan]
But tonight I crossed the line
I used to know her
When my house was sober
I could find lessons in light
Over and over, is it really over?

[Chorus: Dua Lipa, Troye Sivan]
I don't wanna see you go
I want somebody to love me
(Need somebody oh)
Why'd it take so long to know?
I want somebody to love me
(Need somebody oh)
I want somebody to be nice
See the boy that I once was in my eyes
Nobody's gonna save my life


Title: Someone Like You

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I heard that you're settled down
That you found someone and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess he gave you things I couldn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
It ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

[Pre-Chorus]
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I'd hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

[Chorus]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I rеmember you said
Sometimеs it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

[Verse 2]
You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

[Chorus]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

Title: Still Got It

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Cut my hair into a bowl after you told me that you liked it like that
Wish I didn't care at all but now I'm in the mirror with scissors in hand
I saw you at a party, said hello like an old colleague
Talked about the summer when we didn't know each other

[Pre-Chorus]
Was bound to happen, I suppose
But fuck me, now I really know
Yeah, I know

[Chorus]
I still got it bad
I still got it bad
'Cause you've got what you had (Had)
And I still want it (I still want it)
And I still want it bad

[Verse 2]
Getting used to bein' alone, but, babe, a house don't mean a home like before, no (Ah-ah)
Got a place back in Australia, it's different than you remember
I think you'd like it, though (Ah-ah)
You touch mе in the back seat of the party bus on Tеnth Street
Kinda confused me, both a couple drinks in too deep, it

[Pre-Chorus]
Was bound to happen, I suppose
But fuck me, now I really know
Yeah, I know

[Chorus]
I still got it bad
I still got it bad
'Cause you've got what you had (Had)
And I still want it (I still want it)
Yeah, I still want it bad

[Bridge]
Ah-ah
Ah-ah

[Chorus]
We lost what we had (Had)
And now I want it (Now I want it)
Now I want it back
'Cause you still got it

[Outro]
Still got it
Still got it


Title: Strawberries & Cigarettes

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Remember when we first met?
You said, "Light my cigarette"
So I lied to my mum and dad
I jumped the fence and I ran
But we couldn't go very far
'Cause you locked your keys in your car
So you sat and stared at my lips
And I could already feel your kiss

[Chorus]
Long nights, daydreams
Sugar and smoke rings, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
Headlights on me
Racing to 60, I've been a fool
Strawberries and cigarettes always taste like
Blue eyes, black jeans
Lighters and candy, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you

[Verse 2]
Remember when you taught me fate?
Said it'd all be worth the wait
Like that night in the back of the cab
When your fingers walked in my hand
Next day, nothin' on my phone
But I can still smell you on my clothes
Always hopin' that things would change
But we went right back to your games

[Chorus]
Long nights, daydreams
Sugar and smoke rings, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
Headlights on me
Racing to 60, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like
Blue eyes, black jeans
Lighters and candy, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you

[Bridge]
And even if I run away
Give my heart a holiday
Still, strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
You always leave me wanting more
I can't shake my hunger for
Strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
Yeah, they always taste like you, you
Long nights, daydreams
With that sugar and smoke rings
Always taste like you

[Chorus]
Headlights on me
(And even if I run away)
Racing to 60, I've been a fool
(Give my heart a holiday)
Still, strawberries and cigarettes always taste like
Blue eyes, black jeans
(You always leave me wanting more)
Lighters and candy, I've been a fool
(I can't shake my hunger for)
Strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you


Title: STUD

Lyrics:
[Chorus]
Hey, stud
You can come and you can come
And meet me out front
You got all the muscles and the features I want
And I want what I want, my love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Hey, tough
What's it like to be so big and strong and so buff?
Everything I'm not
But could I still be a hunk to you?
Enough for you, a stud to you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse]
Taking the fun out of fucks
Searching for something I'm not
Knowing that you're not the one
(You're the one for right now, yeah)
How much of me would you take?
And how much of me would you change?
On second thought, don't say a thing
('Cause you're the one for right now)

[Pre-Chorus]
Just let me believe that
You like what you're seeing
When you're looking at me
And your heartbeat is speeding
At seven hundred miles down highways to Eden
Like my body's the apple you're eating
Yeah

[Chorus]
Hey, stud
You can come and you can come
And meet me out front
You got all the muscles and the features I want
And I want what I want, my love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh, oh)
(Stud, stud)
(Oh)

[Chorus]
Hey, stud
You can come and you can come
And meet me out front
You got all the muscles and the features I want
And I want what I want, my love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
You're into this, right?
We should do this right
You can make my night
We should do this right
You're into this, right?
We should do this right
You can make my night
We should do this, right?
Right?

[Outro]
Just let me believe that
You like what you're seeing
When you're looking at me
And your heartbeat is speeding
The seven hundred miles
Down highways to Eden
Like my body's the apple you're eating
Yeah
You're into this (Mmm)
We should do this (Mmm)
You're into this (Mmm)
You can make my night (Mmm)
You're into this, right?
You can make my night
You're into this, right?
You can make my night
You're into this
My night
Mmm


Title: SUBURBIA

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
The sun sets longer
Where I am from
Where dreams go to die
While having fun
The boys fix their cars and
Girls eat it up
Loving's so good when
Love is young

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, there's so much history in these streets
And mama's good eats
Oh Wonder on repeat
There's so much history in my head
The people I've left
The ones that I've kept

[Chorus]
Have you heard me on the radio?
Did you turn it up?
On your blown-out stereo
In suburbia
Could be playing hide and seek from home
Can't replace my blood
Yeah, it seems I'm never letting go
Of suburbia

[Verse 2]
Swallow nostalgia
Chase it with lime
Better than dwelling
And chasing time
Missing occasions
I can't rewind
Can't help but feel I've lost what's mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, there's so much history in these streets
And mama's good eats
Oh Wonder on repeat
There's so much history in my head
The people I've left
The ones that I've kept

[Chorus]
Have you heard me on the radio?
Did you turn it up?
On your blown-out stereo
In suburbia
Could be playing hide and seek from home
Can't replace my blood
Yeah, it seems I'm never letting go
Of suburbia

[Bridge]
They all say that nothing ever changes
Through the new lines that are on their faces
They all say that nothing ever changes
Through the new lines that are on their faces

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, there's so much history in these streets
And mama's good eats
Oh Wonder on repeat
There's so much history in my head
The people I've left
The ones that I've kept

[Chorus]
Have you heard me on the radio?
Did you turn it up?
On your blown-out stereo
In suburbia
Could be playing hide and seek from home
Can't replace my blood
Yeah, it seems I'm never letting go
Of suburbia


Title: SUBURBIA - Troye Sivan

Title: Sunflower

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Rose girls in glass vases
Perfect bodies, perfect faces
They all belong in magazines
Those girls the boys are chasing
Winning all the games they're playing
They're always in a different league

[Pre-Chorus]
Stretching toward the sky like I don't care
Wishing you could see me standing there

[Chorus]
But I'm a sunflower, a little funny
If I were a rose, maybe you'd want me
If I could, I'd change overnight
I'd turn into something you'd like
But I'm a sunflower, a little funny
If I were a rose, maybe you'd pick me
But I know you don't have a clue
This sunflower's waiting for you
Waiting for you
But I'm a sunflower, a little funny
And if I were her, maybe you'd pick me
But I know you don't have a clue
This sunflower's waiting for you
Waiting for you

Title: SWIMMING POOLS

Lyrics:
[Intro]
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run

[Verse 1]
So tell me how I'm gonna get past this wave to empty swimming pools
'Cause I just wanna be at the start of after loving you
I plant my feet and I clench my teeth
I can't outrun what's coming after me
So tell me, how am I gonna get past this wave to empty swimming pools?

[Chorus]
But I see a lighthouse in the distance calling my name
But I can't get there till I go through all of this pain
There's a glimmer of hope like an exhale of smoke in the sky
And sometimes you drain out on the shit that used to feel right
Empty swimming pools

[Post-Chorus]
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run

[Verse 2]
So tell me how I'm gonna get past this wave to empty swimming pools
Tell me how I'm gonna feel less secure when I look at you
So I close my eyes and just visualise
The greener skies on the other side
So tell me, how am I gonna get past this wave to empty swimming pools?

[Chorus]
But I see a lighthouse in the distance calling my name
But I can't get there till I go through all of this pain
There's a glimmer of hope like an exhale of smoke in the sky
And sometimes you drain out on the shit that used to feel right
Empty swimming pools
Empty swimming pools
Empty swimming pools
Empty swimming pools

[Post-Chorus]
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run


Title: Take Yourself Home

Lyrics:
[Chorus]
I'm tired of the city, scream if you're with me
If I'm gonna die, let's die somewhere pretty, ah, ah-ah
Sad in the summer, city needs a mother
If I'm gonna waste my time, then it's time to go
Take yourself home

[Verse 1]
Talk to me
There's nothing that can't be fixed with some honesty
And how it got this dark is just beyond to me
If anyone can hear me, switch the lights, oh, oh
And happiness
Is right there where you lost it when you took the bet
Counting all the losses that you can't collect
Got everything and nothing in my life

[Chorus]
I'm tired of the city, scream if you're with me
If I'm gonna die, let's die somewhere pretty, ah, ah-ah
Sad in the summer, city needs a mother
If I'm gonna waste my time, then it's time to go
Take yourself home
Take yourself home

[Verse 2]
Who you really tryna be when they see your face?
Is it worth it tryna win in a losing game?
Well, it's all waiting for you
And boy, I know you're eager
But it just might destroy you
Destroy you, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm tired of the city, scream if you're with me
If I'm gonna die, let's die somewhere pretty, ah, ah-ah
Sad in the summer, city needs a mother
If I'm gonna waste my time, then it's time to go
Take yourself home
Take yourself home

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Take yourself home
Home, oh

[Instrumental Outro]


Title: TALK ME DOWN

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I wanna sleep next to you
But that's all I wanna do right now
And I wanna come home to you
But home is just a room full of my safest sounds
'Cause you know that I can't trust myself with my 3-AM shadow
I'd rather fuel a fantasy than deal with this alone

[Chorus]
I wanna sleep next to you
But that's all I wanna do right now
So come over now and talk me down

[Verse 2]
I wanna hold hands with you
But that's all I wanna do right now
And I wanna get close to you
'Cause your hands and lips still know their way around
And I know I like to draw the line when it starts to get too real
But the less time that I spend with you, the less you need to heal

[Chorus]
I wanna sleep next to you
But that's all I wanna do right now
So come over now and talk me down
(Talk me down)

[Bridge]
So if you don't mind, I'll walk that line
Stuck on the bridge between us
Grey areas and expectations
But I'm not the one if we're honest, yeah
But I wanna sleep next to you
And I wanna come home to you
I wanna hold hands with you
I wanna be close to you

[Outro]
But I wanna sleep next to you
And that's all I wanna do right now
And I wanna come home to you
But home is just a room full of my safest sounds
So come over now and talk me down
(Talk me down)
