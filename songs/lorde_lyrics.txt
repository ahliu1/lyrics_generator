Title: 400 Lux

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
We're never done with killing time
Can I kill it with you
Till the veins run red and blue?
We come around here all the time
Got a lot to not do
Let me kill it with you

[Pre-Chorus]
You pick me up and take me home again
Head out the window again
We're hollow like the bottles that we drain
You drape your wrists over the steering wheel
Pulses can drive from here
We might be hollow but we're brave

[Chorus]
(And I like you)
I love these roads where the houses don't change
(And I like you)
Where we can talk like there's something to say
(And I like you)
I'm glad that we stopped kissing the tar on the highway
(And I like you)
We move in the tree streets
I'd like it if you stayed

[Verse 2]
Now we're wearing long sleeves
And the heating comes on
(You buy me orange juice)
We're getting good at this
Dreams of clean teeth
I can tell that you're tired
But you keep the car on
While you're waiting out front

[Pre-Chorus]
You pick me up and take me home again
Head out the window again
We're hollow like the bottles that we drain
You drape your wrists over the steering wheel
Pulses can drive from here
We might be hollow but we're brave

[Chorus]
(And I like you)
I love these roads where the houses don't change
(And I like you)
Where we can talk like there's something to say
(And I like you)
I'm glad that we stopped kissing the tar on the highway
(And I like you)
We move in the tree streets
I'd like it if you stayed

[Bridge]
We're never done with killing time
Can I kill it with you
Till the veins run red and blue?
We come around here all the time
Got a lot to not do
Let me kill it with you

[Chorus]
(And I like you)
I love these roads where the houses don't change
(And I like you)
Where we can talk like there's something to say
(And I like you)
I'm glad that we stopped kissing the tar on the highway
(And I like you)
We move in the tree streets
I'd like it if you stayed

[Outro]
(And I like you)
(And I like you)
And I like you

Title: All Apologies

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
What else should I be?
All apologies
What else could I say?
Everyone is gay
What else could I write?
I don't have the right
What else should I be?
All apologies

[Chorus]
In the sun, in the sun, I feel as one
In the sun, in the sun
Married, buried

[Verse 2]
I wish I was like you
Easily amused
Find my nest of salt
Everything is my fault
I'll take all the blame
Aqua seafoam shame
Sunburn, freezer burn
Choking on the ashes of her enemy

[Chorus]
In the sun, in the sun, I feel as one
In the sun, in the sun
Married, buried
Married, buried
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are


Title: All My Love

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Sometimes I think we're the brightest stars
And I try to believe we'll find a way
Will life change, will our hearts turn colder? (Major Lazer)
All the rhythms in my heart lift me up inside
We can stay out of the trouble, is it worth the blame?
Is it true that the more you give, the more they take?
All the rhythms in my heart lift me up and say

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Only love will make us ache
Only love is worth the chase
All my love, I know we're waiting for this
On the rocks up on the mountaintops

[Post-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
All my love
All my love
All my love
Up on the mountaintop

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
All the rhythms in my heart lift me up and say
We're just a mess of broken people but we love the game
I would do anything for us, it's worth the pain
All the rhythms in my heart lift me up and say

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Only love will make us ache
Only love is worth the chase
All my love, I know we're waiting for this
On the rocks up on the mountaintops

[Post-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
All my love
All my love
All my love
Up on the mountaintop
All my love
All my love
All my love
Up on the mountaintop

[Bridge: Ariana Grande]
You're always on my mind
Oh, there'll come a day
Day where we can fly
Reach the glory haze, oh, hey
High up in the sun in the brighter sky
Sun in the brighter sky

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Only love will make us ache
Only love is worth the chase
All my love, I know we're waiting for this
On the rocks up on the mountaintops

[Post-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
All my love
All my love
All my love
Up on the mountaintop
All my love
All my love
All my love
Up on the mountaintop


Title: A World Alone

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
That slow burn wait while it gets dark
Bruising the sun
I feel grown up with you in your car
I know it's dumb

[Verse 2]
We've both got a million bad habits to kick
Not sleeping is one
We're biting our nails, you're biting my lip
I'm biting my tongue

[Refrain]
The people are talking, people are talking
The people are talking, people are talking

[Chorus]
Raise a glass, 'cause I'm not done sayin' it
They all wanna get rough, get away with it
Let 'em talk, 'cause we're dancing in this world alone
World alone, we're alone

[Verse 3]
All my fake friends and all of their noise
Complain about work
They're studying business, I study the floor
And you haven't stopped smoking all night
Maybe the Internet raised us
Or maybe people are jerks

[Refrain]
The people are talking, people are talking
(But not you)
The people are talking, people are talking

[Chorus]
Raise a glass, 'cause I'm not done sayin' it
They all wanna get rough, get away with it
Let 'em talk, 'cause we're dancing in this world alone
World alone, we're alone
All the double-edged people and schemes
They make a mess, then go home and get clean
You're my best friend and we're dancing in a world alone
A world alone, we're all alone

[Bridge]
I know we're not everlasting
We're a train wreck waiting to happen
One day the blood won't flow so gladly
One day we'll all get still, get still

[Refrain]
The people are talking, people are talking
The people are talking, people are talking
The people are talking, people are talking
The people are talking, people are talking

[Chorus]
Raise a glass, 'cause I'm not done sayin' it
They all wanna get rough, get away with it
Let 'em talk, 'cause we're dancing in this world alone
World alone, we're alone
All the double-edged people in schemes
They make a mess, then go home and get clean
You're my best friend and we're dancing in a world alone
A world alone, we're all alone

[Outro]
The people are talking, people are talking
The people are talking, people are talking
The people are talking, people are talking
The people are talking, people are talking
Let 'em talk

Title: Big Star

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Everyone knows that you're too good for me, don't they?
I'm a cheater, I lie, and I'm shy
But you like to say hello to total strangers
Shivering pines and walls of colour
I can't believe I used to stay inside

[Pre-Chorus]
But every perfect summer's gotta say goodnight
Now I watch you run through the amber light
I used to love the party, now I'm not alright
Drinking in the dark, take me home tonight

[Chorus]
Baby, you're a big star
You're a big star
Wanna take your picture

[Verse 2]
I toss up if it's worth it now every time I get on a plane
I've got so much to tеll you and not enough time to do it in

[Pre-Chorus]
But evеry perfect summer's gotta take its flight
I'll still watch you run through the winter light
I used to love the party, now I'm not alright
Hope the honeybees make it home tonight

[Chorus]
Baby, you're a big star
You're a big star
Wanna take your picture

[Outro]
'Til I die
'Til I die
'Til I die


Title: Biting Down

Lyrics:
[Intro]
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down

[Verse 1]
Skip a hit, don't make a sound
(It feels better biting down)
Breathed so deep I thought I'd drown
(It feels better biting down)
Listen to the beats resound
(It feels better biting down)
It feels better biting down
(It feels better biting down)

[Refrain]
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down

[Verse 2]
Skip a hit, don't make a sound
(It feels better biting down)
Breathed so deep I thought I'd drown
(It feels better biting down)
Listen to the beats resound
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down

[Bridge]
The electronics of your heart
See how fast they fall apart
(It feels better biting down)
The electronics of your heart
See how fast they fall apart
(It feels better biting down)
It feels better biting down

[Outro]
Skip a hit, don't make a sound
(It feels better biting down)


Title: Blouse

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Here we are, quiet at your kitchen table
With courtesy to little pet peeves
Napkins on laps, strands pulled back
I hang the scarf and my mom's anorak

[Chorus]
Why do I tell you how I feel
When you're just looking down the blouse?
It's something I wouldn't say out loud
If touch could make them hear, then touch me now
If touch could make them hear, then touch me now

[Verse 2]
Talking to some who laugh and others scorned
I guess humor could help me after all
It's funny now, I'm just useless and a whore
But I get a cosign from your favorite one-man show

[Chorus]
Why do I tell you how I feel
When you're too busy looking down my blouse?
It's something I wouldn't say out loud
If touch could make them hear, then touch me now
If touch could make them hear, then touch me now
If touch could make them hear, then touch me now
Now

[Outro]
Mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm


Title: Bravado

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
All my life, I've been fighting a war
I can't talk to you or your friends
It's not only you
My heart jumps around when I'm alluded to
This will not do
'Cause I was raised up
To be admired, to be noticed
But when you're withdrawn, it's the closest thing
To assault when all eyes are on you
This will not do

[Verse 2]
I'm faking glory
Lick my lips, toss my hair
And turn the smile on
And the story's brand new
But I can take it from here
I'll find my own bravado

[Chorus]
It's a switch flipped
It's a pill tipped back, it's a moon eclipse, whoa
And I can tell you that
When the lights come on, I'll be ready for this
It's in your bloodstream
A collision of atoms that happens before your eyes
It's a marathon run
Or a mountain you scaled without thinking of size
I was frightened of
Every little thing that I thought was out to get me down
To trip me up and laugh at me, but
I learned not to want
The quiet of a room with no-one around to find me out
I want the applause, the approval
The things that make me go, "Oh"

[Instumental Break]

[Chorus]
It's a switch flipped
It's a pill tipped back, it's a moon eclipse, whoa
And I can tell you that
When the lights come on, I'll be ready for this
It's in your bloodstream
A collision of atoms that happens before your eyes
It's a marathon run
Or a mountain you scaled without thinking of size
I was frightened of
Every little thing that I thought was out to get me down
To trip me up and laugh at me, but
I learned not to want
The quiet of a room with no-one around to find me out
I want the applause, the approval
The things that make me go, "Oh"

Title: Break the Ice

Lyrics:
[Spoken Intro: Britney Spears]
But I'm here now

[Verse 1]
I know it's been a while, but I'm glad you came
And I was thinking 'bout how you say my name
You got my body spinning, like a hurricane
It feels like I'm going insane
So, let me get it up

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, looks like we're alone now
You ain't gotta be scared, we're grown now
I'ma hit defrost on ya, let's get it blazin'
We can turn the heat up if ya wanna
Turn the lights down low if ya wanna
Just wanna move ya, but you froze up

[Chorus]
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
That ya warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel
Let me break the icе
Allow me to get you right
That ya warm up to me
Baby, I can makе you feel hot, hot, hot, hot


Title: Buzzcut Season

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I remember when your head caught flame
It kissed your scalp and caressed your brain
(I remember when your head caught flame)
Well, you laughed, baby, it's okay
It's buzzcut season, anyway
(Well, you laughed, baby, it's okay)

[Pre-Chorus]
Explosions on TV
And all the girls with heads inside a dream
So now we live beside the pool
Where everything is good

[Verse 2]
We ride the bus with the knees pulled in
People should see how we're living
(We ride the bus with the knees pulled in)
Shut my eyes to the song that plays
Sometimes this has a hot, sweet taste
(Shut my eyes to the song that plays)

[Pre-Chorus]
The men up on the news
They try to tell us all that we will lose
But it's so easy in this blue
Where everything is good

[Chorus]
And I'll never go home again
(Place the call, feel it start)
Favourite friend
(And nothing's wrong when nothing's true)
I live in a hologram with you
We're all the things that we do for fun
(And I'll breathe, and it goes)
Play along
(Make-believe it's hyper real)
But I live in a hologram with you

[Bridge]
Cola with the burnt-out taste
I'm the one you tell your fears to
There'll never be enough of us

[Pre-Chorus]
Explosions on TV
And all the girls with heads inside a dream
So now we live beside the pool
Where everything is good

[Chorus]
And I'll never go home again
(Place the call, feel it start)
Favourite friend
(And nothing's wrong when nothing's true)
I live in a hologram with you
We're all the things that we do for fun
(And I'll breathe, and it goes)
Play along
(Make-believe it's hyper real)
But I live in a hologram with you

Title: California

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Once upon a time in Hollywood
When Carole called my name
I stood up, the room exploded, and I
Knew that's it, I'll never be the same
That's when the doors swung open
And a voice said, "We're glad you came"
Now I've spent thousands on you, darling
All the hotels and the jets
And I'd pay it all again to have your golden body back in my bed
But I don't miss the poison arrows aimed directly at my head

[Pre-Chorus]
Goodbye to all the bottles, all the models
Bye to the clouds in thе skies that all hold no rain

[Chorus]
Don't want that California love
Don't want that California love
Don't want that California lovе

[Verse 2]
Oh, once upon a time, the Canyon store
Was where my world began
All that mystery and beauty gleaned from desert flowers and gifted children
But it got hard to grow up with your cool hand around my neck
Now in my hometown, sunbathing
My girlfriends and my baby
But every time I smell tequila
The garden grows up in my mind again

[Pre-Chorus]
Goodbye to all the bottles, all the models
Bye to the kids in the lines for the new Supreme

[Chorus]
Don't want that California love
Don't want that California love
Don't want that California love
Don't want that California love
Don't want that California love
Don't want that California love

[Outro]
(Hmm) It's just a dream
(Hmm) It's just a dream
(Hmm) It's all just a dream
(Hmm) I wanna wake up, I wanna wake up


Title: Calm The Fire

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Calm the fire, do not fight anymore
They don’t know what they’re saying, they don’t know anything at all
For all that matters is you know that this is not their fault

All the places we should never go
Lost between the cracks something wicked waits below
And all I’m saying there are some things better left unseen at all

[Quote: Furry Vengeance]
Dan Screaming

[Verse 2]
It’s been so long it’s tearing me apart
I cannot understand or comprehend
Where we went wrong. Now we’ve come so far
The madness in our hearts will nеver end

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Cause I’vе seen it all
I can’t fight it anymore
If I had burned forevermore
Is there nothing left to save?

[Chorus]
Cause now more than ever what we need
Is love to replace all the obscene
Something good and something beautiful, if only we could see
That now more than ever what we need
Is a little love

[Verse 3]
Is there no more have we gone too far?
There’s nothing I can do to make you sway
To see the blood running through our hearts
No different from the blood we’ve come to hate

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When I close my eyes
I dream that we are colorblind
And now you know you can’t deny
Only ignorance to blame

[Chorus]
Cause now more than ever what we need
Is love to replace all the obscene
Something good and something beautiful, if only we could see
That now more than ever what we need
Is a little love

[Bridge]
Now let it calm the fire
That burns within your heart tonight
For some are too blind to see
The world as it’s meant to be

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When I close my eyes
I dream that we are colorblind
And now you know you can’t deny
Only ignorance to blame

[Chorus]
Cause now more than ever what we need
Is love to replace all the obscene
Something good and something beautiful, if only we could see
That now more than ever what we need
Is a little love


Title: Dominoes

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I heard that you were doing yoga
With Uma Thurman's mother
Just outside of Woodstock
Now you're watering all the flowers
You planted with your new girlfriend
Outside on the rooftop

[Pre-Chorus]
Just another phase you're rushing on through
Go all New Age, outrunning your blues

[Chorus]
Fifty gleaming chances in a row
Then I watch you flick them down like dominoes
Must feel good being Mr. Start-Again

[Verse 2]
I know
Know a girl who knows a
Another girl who knows the woman that you hurt
It's strange to see you smoking marijuana
You used to do the most cocaine
Of anyone I'd ever met

[Pre-Chorus]
Just another phase you're shooting on through
The whole world changеs right around you

[Chorus]
You get fifty gleaming chances in a row
And I watch you flick thеm down like dominoes
Must feel good being Mr. Start-Again
Yeah, it must feel good being Mr. Start-Again (Don't get up)
Yeah, it must feel good being Mr. Start-Again


Title: Don’t Take the Money

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Jack Antonoff]
Somebody broke me once
Love was a currency
A shimmering balance act
I think that I laughed at that
And I saw your face and hands
Colored in sun and then
I think I understand
Will I understand?

[Pre-Chorus: Jack Antonoff]
Will we fight, stay up late?
In my dreams, I'm to blame
Different sides of the bed
Roll your eyes, shave my head
Now we're stuck in the storm
We were born to ignore
And all I got is a chance to just say
(“Baby, love me! You've got me, runaway!”)

[Chorus: Jack Antonoff]
You steal the air out of my lungs, you make me feel it
I pray for everything we lost, buy back the secrets
Your hand forever's all I want
Don't take the money
Don't take the money

[Verse 2: Jack Antonoff]
I slept on my own those nights
Was still in my parents' house
And I cut off my t-shirt sleeves
And claim a new continent
'Til I saw your face and hands
Covered in sun and then
I think I understand
Will I understand?

[Pre-Chorus: Jack Antonoff]
Will we fight, stay up late?
In my dreams, I'm to blame
Different sides of the bed
Roll your eyes, shake my head
Now we're stuck in the storm
We were born to ignore
And all I got is a chance to just say
(“Baby, love me! You've got me, runaway!”)

[Chorus: Jack Antonoff]
You steal the air out of my lungs, you make me feel it
I pray for everything we lost, buy back the secrets
Your hand forever's all I want
Don't take the money
Don't take the money
(“Baby, love me! You've got me, runaway!”)
You steal the air out of my lungs, you make me feel it
I pray for everything we lost, buy back the secrets
Your hand forever's all I want
Don't take the money
Don't take the money
(“Baby, love me! You've got me, runaway!”)

[Bridge: Jack Antonoff]
When you're looking at your shadow
Standing on the edge of yourself
Praying on the darkness
Just don't take the money
Dreaming of an easy
Waking up without weight now
And you're looking at the heartless
Just don't take the money

[Chorus: Jack Antonoff & Lorde]
You steal the air out of my lungs, you make me feel it
I pray for everything we lost, buy back the secrets
Your hand forever's all I want
Don't take the money
Well, don't take the money
(“Baby, love me! You've got me, runaway!”)
You steal the air out of my lungs, you make me feel it
I pray for everything we lost, buy back the secrets
Your hand forever's all I want
Don't take the money
Don't take the money

[Outro: Jack Antonoff]
Just don't take the money
Just don't take the money
Just don't take the money
Just don't take the money

Don't take the money
But don't take the money

That's right, right, right

Rhythm is a dancer, I need a companion
Ooh, I guess that must be you
Body like the summer, ooh you like no other
Don't you tell 'em what we do, oh

Don't tell 'em
Don't tell 'em
You ain't even gotta tell 'em
Don't, don't
You ain't even gotta tell 'em
Don't, don't
Don't you tell 'em
So, you ain't even gotta tell 'em
You ain't even gotta tell 'em
Don't, don't
You ain't even gotta tell 'em
Don't, don't
You ain't even gotta tell 'em
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't tell 'em
Don't
Don't tell 'em
Don't tell 'em


Title: Drew, so confusing

Lyrics:
Lyrics from snippets

[Chorus: Charli xcx]
Girl, it's so confusing sometimes to be a girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, it's so confusing sometimes to be a girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, how do you feel being a girl?
Girl, girl, girl
How do you feel being a girl?
Girl, girl, girl
Man, I don't know, I'm just a girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl

[Verse 1: Ky Newman]
Well, honestly I was speechless
When I saw you and Josiah
He told me you had been fucking
Let's work it out on the remix
Remember how close we were
Maybe I loved you too much
And now we barely hang out
I'm just a studio munch
And for the last couple years
I've been letting you in
Letting you hit my back wall
Over and over again
Then one day it all changed
When that white boy showed up
It was love at first sight
And then he fucked it all up
Drew, you threw me away
And broke my heart into pieces
And then you spit in my face
And now I'm gonna fucking kill myself
But then this morning I realized
That it might've been me
And if there's something you love
You gotta let it be free

[Pre-Chorus: Ky Newman]
'Cause we don't have the same hair
And we don't look alike
I'm just a victim of twink death
Was I ever your type?
And when we put this to bed
The internet will go crazy
I'm glad I know how you feel
'Cause I would ride for you Enya

[Chorus: Charli xcx & Lorde]
Girl, it's so confusing sometimes to be a girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, it's so confusing sometimes to be a girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, how do you feel being a girl?
Girl, girl, girl
How do you feel being a girl?
Girl, girl, girl
Man, I don't know, I'm just a girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl

[Verse 2: Drew Phillips]
I was fuckin' Josiah
I was havin' so much fun
I didn't know it made you jealous
I was fuckin' everyone
Just like you were saying
I was meant to be free
You would hold me down real tight
And I just couldn't even breathe
I just needed some distance
So I build up the fence
I just built it really tall
I didn't even want you in
When I runnin' away
I realized that I was gay
I just need my cock, I am my life
And I wanted you to see
I thought that I was dreaming when I first heard your email
Can't believe what I'm reading
And your heart has been bleeding
If it's between you and Josey
You both know who that I'll go to
You got the key to my heart
And I just want to restart

[Pre-Chorus: Drew Phillips]
Let's take it back to the top
Because I'm more of a bottom
I just want you to use me
Why don't you just abuse me?
You were feeling neglected
And I totally get it
Now I know how you feel
And I would ride for you Ky

[Chorus: Charli xcx & Lorde]
Girl, it's so confusing sometimes to be a girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, it's so confusing sometimes to be a girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, how do you feel being a girl?
Girl, girl, girl
How do you feel being a girl?
Girl, girl, girl
Man, I don't know, I'm just a girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl


Title: Easy (Switch Screens)

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Easy, easy
Pull out your heart to make the
Being alone
Easy, easy
Pull out your heart to make the
Being alone
Easy, easy

[Verse 2]
Easy, easy
You switch the screens over the
Rest of your flows
Easy, easy
They poke around until they
Get what they want
Easy, easy

[Verse 3]
Oh, easy, easy
Throw out the lunch you pay for
Thought it would suck, but now it's
Easy, oh, easy
Throw out the lunch you pay for
Oh, easy, easy

[Verse 4]
Easy, easy
Pull out the heart that keeps you
Feeling alone
Easy, easy
Pull out your heart to make the
Being alone
Easy


Title: Everybody Wants To Rule The World

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Welcome to your life
There's no turning back
Even while we sleep
We will find you
Acting on your best behaviour
Turn your back on Mother Nature

[Refrain]
Everybody wants to rule the world

[Verse 2]
It's my own desire
It's my own remorse
Help me to decide
Help me make the most of freedom
And of pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever

[Refrain]
Everybody wants to rule the world

[Chorus]
There's a room where the light won't find you
Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
When they do, I'll be right behind you
So glad we've almost made it
So sad we had to fade it
Everybody wants to rule the world
Everybody wants to rule the world
Everybody wants to rule the world


Title: Fallen Fruit

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
To the ones who came before us
All the golden ones who were lifted on a wing
We had no idea the dreams we had were far too big
Far too big

[Verse 2]
And we will walk together (We will walk)
Psychedelic garlands in our hair
Through the halls of splendor where the apple trees all grew
You'll leave us dancing on the fallen fruit

[Chorus]
The fallen fruit
The fallen fruit (Ooh)
The fallen fruit
[Bridge]
From the Nissan to the Phantom to the plane
We'll disappear in the cover of the rain
Took the great minds and the vapers
And a pocketful of seed
It's time for us to leave

[Verse 3]
And we will walk together (We will walk)
Psychedelic garlands in our hair
But how can I love what I know I am gonna lose?
Don't make me choose

[Chorus]
The fallen fruit
The fallen fruit
The fallen fruit


Title: Flashing Lights

Lyrics:
Flashing lights
Flashing lights
Flashing lights
Flashing lights

As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
What do I know?
(Flashing lights)
What do I know?
(Flashing lights)

As you can see we're living [?]
But I never thought that you would be just like you seems
What do I know?


Title: Flicker (Kanye West Rework)

Lyrics:
[Produced by Kanye West]

[Verse 1]
I'm a princess cut from marble, smoother than a storm
And the scars that mark my body, they're silver and gold
My blood is a flood of rubies, precious stones
It keeps my veins hot, the fires find a home in me
I move through town, I'm quiet like a fight
And my necklace is of rope, I tie it and untie it

[Pre-Chorus]
And now people talk to me, but nothing ever hits home
People talk to me, and all the voices just burn holes
I'm done with it (Ooh)

[Chorus]
This is the start of how it all ends
They used to shout my name, now they whisper it
I'm speeding up and this is the
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
We're at the start, the colors disappear
I never watch the stars, there's so much down here
So I just try to keep up with them
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart

[Verse 2]
I dream all year, but they're not the sweet kinds
And the shivers move down my shoulder blades in double time

[Pre-Chorus]
And now people talk to me I'm slipping out of reach now
People talk to me, and all their faces blur
But I got my fingers laced together and I made a little prison
And I'm locking up everyone who ever laid a finger on me
I'm done with it (Ooh)

[Chorus]
This is the start of how it all ends
They used to shout my name, now they whisper it
I'm speeding up and this is the
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
We're at the start, the colors disappear
I never watch the stars, there's so much down here
So I just try to keep up with them
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart

[Outro]
And this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat
Sparking up my heart
And this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat-beat-beat-beat


Title: Foil

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I never seem to finish all my food
I always get a doggie bag from the waiter
So I just keep what's still unchewed
And I take it home, save it for later

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But then I deal with fungal rot, bacterial formation
Microbes, enzymes, mold, and oxidation
I don't care; I've got a secret trick up my sleeve
I never bother with baggies, glass jars, Tupperware containers
Plastic cling wrap, really a no-brainer
I just like to keep all my flavors sealed in tight

[Chorus]
With aluminum foil (Foil)
Never settle for less
That kind of wrap is just the best
To keep your sandwich nice and fresh
Stick it in your cooler (Cooler)
Eat it when you're ready
But maybe you'll choose (You'll choose, you'll choose, you'll choose)
A refreshing herbal tea
Mmm, lovely!

[Verse 2]
Oh, by the way, I've cracked the code
I've figured out these shadow organizations
And the Illuminati know
That they're finally primed for world domination

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And soon you've got black helicopters comin' cross the border
Puppet masters for the New World Order
Be aware, there's always someone that's watching you
And still, the government won't admit they faked the whole moon landing
Thought-control rays, psychotronic scanning
Don't mind that, I'm protected 'cause I made this hat

[Chorus]
From aluminum foil (foil)
Wear a hat that's foil lined
In case an alien's inclined
To probe your butt or read your mind
Looks a bit peculiar ('culiar)
Seems a little crazy
But someday I'll prove (I'll prove, I'll prove, I'll prove)
There's a big conspiracy


Title: Glory and Gore

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
There's a humming in the restless summer air
And we're slipping off the course that we prepared
But in all chaos, there is calculation
(Drop-drop-drop-drop) Dropping glasses just to hear them break
You've been drinking like the world was gonna end (It didn't)
Took a shiner from the fist of your best friend (Go figure)
It's clear that someone's gotta go
We mean it, but I promise we're not mean

[Pre-Chorus]
And the cry goes out (Oh)
They lose their minds for us
And how it plays out (Oh)
Now we're in the ring and we're coming for blood

[Chorus]
(Oh, oh) You could try and take us
(Oh, oh) But we're the gladiators
(Oh, oh) Everyone a rager
(Oh, oh) But secretly they're saviours
Glory and gore go hand in hand
That's why we're making headlines
(Oh, oh) You could try and take us
(Oh, oh) But victory's contagious

[Verse 2]
Delicate in every way but one (The swordplay)
God knows we like archaic kinds of fun (The old ways)
Chance is the only game I play with, baby
We let our battles choose us

[Pre-Chorus]
And the cry goes out (Oh)
They lose their minds for us
And how it plays out (Oh)
Now we're in the ring and we're coming for blood

[Chorus]
(Oh, oh) You could try and take us
(Oh, oh) But we're the gladiators
(Oh, oh) Everyone a rager
(Oh, oh) But secretly they're saviours
Glory and gore go hand in hand
That's why we're making headlines
(Oh, oh) You could try and take us
(Oh, oh) But victory's contagious

[Bridge]
No-one 'round here's good at keeping their eyes closed
The sun's starting to light up when we're walking home
Tired little laughs, gold-lie promises
We'll always win at this, I don't ever think about death
It's all right if you do, it's fine
We gladiate, but I guess we're really fighting ourselves
Roughin' up our minds so we're ready when the killtime comes
Wide awake in bed, words in my brain
"Secretly you love this, do you even wanna go free?"
Let me in the ring, I'll show you what that big word means

[Chorus]
(Oh, oh) You could try and take us
(Oh, oh) But we're the gladiators
(Oh, oh) Everyone a rager
(Oh, oh) But secretly they're saviours
Glory and gore go hand in hand
That's why we're making headlines
(Oh, oh) You could try and take us
(Oh, oh) But victory's contagious

Title: Goodbye

Lyrics:
I like the thought you think of me
It's softer as I start to sink


Title: Good Fights

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Face the world, tell your friends
You don’t really love them
But you really love when
Braid your hair and give in
We could try to get in to the place where it ends
Where everything ends, it spins again

[Chorus]
Oh, I didn't come all this way just to blow the night
Oh, you can feel sorry for people that are in your mind
Oh, and if it feels close, even when you don’t feel alright
(It’s alright, it’s alright)
Everyone stay up like a good fight

[Verse 2]
There's a place in your head for what doesn't make sense
For the things you don’t get
Look them up when you get in
We could try to get in, get rejected again
Laugh it off again, I guess oh well

[Chorus]
Oh, I didn't come all this way just to blow the night
Oh, you can feel sorry for people are in your mind
Oh, and if it feels close, even when you don’t feel alright
(It’s alright, it’s alright)
Everyone stay up like a good fight

[Bridge]
Incurred on to bright green eyes
You used to love to spend up time
Driving like a coil in the little lights out
Money, we solve our safe
She'll toss her head and play again
Examine every face and realize
Oh, it's good to feel again

[Chorus]
Oh, I didn't come all this way just to blow the night
Oh, you can feel sorry for people are in your mind
Oh, and if it feels close, even when you don’t feel alright
(It’s alright, it’s alright)
Everyone stay up like a good fight


Title: Green Light

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I do my makeup in somebody else's car
We order different drinks at the same bars
I know about what you did and I wanna scream the truth
She thinks you love the beach, you're such a damn liar

[Refrain]
Well those great whites, they have big teeth
Hope they bite you
Thought you said that you would always be in love
But you're not in love no more
Did it frighten you
How we kissed when we danced on the light up floor?
On the light up floor

[Pre-Chorus]
But I hear sounds in my mind
Brand new sounds in my mind
But honey I'll be seein' you wherever I go
But honey I'll be seein' you down every road
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it

[Chorus]
'Cause honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Oh, I wish I could get my things and just let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I wake up in a different bedroom
I whisper things, the city sings 'em back to you

[Refrain]
Well those rumors, they have big teeth
Hope they bite you
Thought you said that you would always be in love
But you're not in love no more
Did it frighten you
How we kissed when we danced on the light up floor?
On the light up floor

[Pre-Chorus]
But I hear sounds in my mind
Brand new sounds in my mind
But honey I'll be seein' you wherever I go
But honey I'll be seein' you down every road
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it

[Chorus]
'Cause honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Oh, honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Yes, honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Oh, I wish I could get my things and just let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it

[Outro]
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it


Title: Hang With Me

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Jack Antonoff]
Will you tell me once again
How we're gonna be just friends?
If you're for real and not pretend
Then I guess you can hang with me

[Verse 2: Lorde]
When my patience wearing thin
When I'm ready to give in
Will you pick me up again?
Then I guess you can hang with me

[Pre-Chorus: Lorde]
And if you do me right
I'm gonna do right by you
And if you keep it tight
I'm gonna confide in you
I know what's on your mind
There will be time for that too
If you hang with me

[Chorus: Lorde]
Just don't fall recklessly
Headlessly in love with me
Cause it's gonna be
All heartbreak, blissfully painful and insanity
If we agree
Oh, you can hang with me

[Verse 3: Jack Antonoff]
When you see me drift astray
And I'm out of touch and out of place
Oh, won't you tell me to my face?
Then I guess you can hang with me

[Pre-Chorus: Lorde]
And if you do me right
I'm gonna do right by you
And if you keep it tight
I'm gonna confide in you
I know what's on your mind
There will be time for that too
If you hang with me

[Chorus: Lorde]
Just don't fall recklessly
Headlessly in love with me
Cause it's gonna be
All heartbreak, blissfully painful and insanity baby
If we agree
Oh, you can hang with me

[Chorus: Lorde & Jack Antonoff]
Just don't fall recklessly
Headlessly in love with me
Cause it's gonna be
All heartbreak, blissfully painful and insanity baby
If we agree
Oh, you can hang with me

You can hang with me
Yeah, you can hang with me
You can hang with me


Title: Hard Feelings/Loveless

Lyrics:
[Part I: Hard Feelings]

[Intro]
Go back and tell it

[Verse 1]
Please, could you be tender?
And I will sit close to you
Let's give it a minute before we admit that we're through
Guess this is the winter
Our bodies are young and blue
I'm at Jungle City, it's late and this song is for you

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I remember the rush, when forever was us
Before all of the winds of regret and mistrust
Now we sit in your car and our love is a ghost
Well, I guess I should go, yeah, I guess I should go

[Chorus]
Hard feelings
These are what they call hard feelings of love
When sweet words and fevers
All leave us right here in the cold, oh, oh
Alone with the hard feelings of love
God, I wish I believed ya
When you told me this was my home, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
I light all the candles
Cut flowers for all my rooms
I care for myself the way I used to care about you
These days, we kiss and we keep busy
The waves come after midnight
I call from underwater
Why even try to get right?
When you've outgrown a lover (Oh)
The whole world knows but you (Oh)
It's time to let go of this endless summer afternoon

[Chorus]
Hard feelings
These are what they call hard feelings of love
When sweet words and fevers
All leave us right here in the cold, oh, oh
Alone with the hard feelings of love
God, I wish I believed ya
When you told me this was my home, oh, oh

[Outro]
Three years, loved you every single day
Made me weak, it was real for me, yeah, real for me
Now I'll fake it every single day
'Til I don't need fantasy, 'til I feel you leave
But I still remember everything
How we'd drift buying groceries, how you'd dance for me
I'll start letting go of little things
'Til I'm so far away from you, far away from you, yeah

[Part II: Loveless]
[Spoken Intro]
"What is this tape?"
"This is my favorite tape"
[Verse 1]
Bet you wanna rip my heart out
Bet you wanna skip my calls now
Well, guess what? I'd like that
'Cause I'm gonna mess your life up
Gonna wanna tape my mouth shut
Look out, lovers

[Chorus]
We're L-O-V-E-L-E-S-S generation
L-O-V-E-L-E-S-S generation
All fuckin' with our lovers' heads generation

Gonna wanna tape my mouth shut
Look out, lovers

Title: Hate That You Know Me

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Jack Antonoff]
I've been talking to strangers
Acting like I'm a stranger
Look like I've been up all night
And you know what? I hate it
I put my things into boxes
Carry all of my old lies
Rubber band in my past time
And you know what? I hate it

[Pre-Chorus: Jack Antonoff]
Oo-oo-ooh
Long way down
You're such a heart attack
But it feels like oo-oo-ooh
Pressure points
They pressure you right back
Come on, think about it

[Chorus: Jack Antonoff & Carly Rae Jepsen]
Sometimes I hate that you know me so well (so well)
Sometimes I, I hate that you know me so well
Some days I, I wish that I wasn't myself
No luck!
And I hate that you know me so well

[Verse 2: Jack Antonoff]
Washed the fear from my hands off
Caught mistakes in the sidewalk
Act like I've been up all night
And you know what? I hate it
So I keep talking about eighteen
'Cause I can't let go of the same dream
Rubber band in my past time
And you know what? I hate it!

[Pre-Chorus: Jack Antonoff]
Oo-oo-ooh
Long way down
You're such a heart attack
But it feels like oo-oo-ooh
Pressure points
They pressure you right back
Come on, think about it

[Chorus: Jack Antonoff & Carly Rae Jepsen]
Sometimes I hate that you know me so well (so well)
Sometimes I, I hate that you know me so well (and I hate ya)
Some days I, I wish that I wasn't myself (No)
No luck! (No)
And I hate that you know me so well
Sometimes (Sometimes) I hate that you know me so well (I hate that you know me)
Sometimes (Sometimes) I hate that you know me so well
Some days I, I wish that I wasn't myself (myself)
No luck! (No!)
And I hate that you know me so well

[Bridge: Carly Rae Jepsen]
And I hate that you know me so well (yeah)
And I hate that you know me so well

[Chorus: Jack Antonoff & Carly Rae Jepsen]
Sometimes I hate that you know me so well (so well)
Sometimes I, I hate that you know me so well (and I hate ya)
Some days I, I wish that I wasn't myself (No)
No luck! (No)
And I hate that you know me so well
Sometimes (Sometimes) I hate that you know me so well (I hate that you know me)
Sometimes (Sometimes) I hate that you know me so well
Some days I, I wish that I wasn't myself (myself)
No luck!
And I hate that you know me so well


Title: Heartbreaking Love

Lyrics:
I just want your love
I, I just want your love

Heartbreaking love

Title: Heartlines

Lyrics:
[Intro]
We could fool the datelines
We could jump the state lines
I don't always play nice
But I wanna feel your heartlines
I wanna feel your heart

[Verse 1]
Have you been let down by the ones before?
Do you leave too soon to know?
Never fell in love cause I just cut loose
But not when it comes to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Dressing in black, you're around for the weekend
Dancing at night, you're the light that I won't let go
And I want you close

[Chorus]
We could fool the datelines
We could jump the state lines
I don't always play nice
But I wanna feel your heartlines
I'll pick you up at midnight
We'll run to beat the sunlight
We only get the one life
And I wanna feel your heartlines
I wanna feel your heart

[Verse 2]
Now we're far apart, in and out of touch
And the words don't mean as much
So I sit across from someone new
But they don't compare to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Lying in bed wide awake, I remember
Dancing at night, you're the light that I won't let go
And I want you close

[Chorus]
We could fool the datelines
We could jump the state lines
I don't always play nice
But I wanna feel your heartlines
I'll pick you up at midnight
We'll run to beat the sunlight
We only get the one life
And I wanna feel your heartlines
I wanna feel your heartlines

[Bridge]
And I won't let go
Lying in bed wide awake, I remember
I feel
Dressing in black
You are here for the weekend
And I won't let go
'Cause I want you close

[Chorus]
We could fool the datelines
We could jump the state lines
I don't always play nice
But I wanna feel your heartlines
I'll pick you up at midnight
We'll run to beat the sunlight
We only get the one life
And I wanna feel your heartlines

[Chorus]
We could fool the datelines
We could jump the state lines
I don't always play nice
But I wanna feel your heartlines
I wanna feel your heartlines
I wanna feel your heartlines
I wanna feel your heart


Title: Helen of Troy

Lyrics:
[Intro]
Hey, hey

[Verse 1]
You've heard it all before
One minute, I was killing 'em all
And the next, a brown suit wouldn't let me perform, ah
Typical
So I took a happy face
And it's coming on like a charm
I don't wanna get lost, I wanna worship the sun
If you want, you can come

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm in my own little golden age
But it's such a pill when they don't appreciate

[Chorus]
So when you smoke that cigarette
Or when you talk shit 'bout an old friend
I know it's hard, but do your best
Give yourself a break, have a little faith, ah
Let's hear it for the girls
Living in the modеrn world

[Verse 2]
They're banging on the door
"Evеryone please make way
For the girl who looks like she flew in from outer space
Yesterday, eh"
I think I'll wait it out
My little thing is keeping 'em keen
They could be drinking with you, but they'll be looking at me
This whole time, I've been playing it coy
The city's falling for me just like I'm Helen of Troy, ah

[Chorus]
So when you're broke, can't get ahead
Or when you take it out on your boyfriend
I know it's hard, but do your best
Give yourself a break, have a little faith
Let's hear it for the girls
Living in the modern world

[Outro]
Give yourself a break, have a little faith
Let's hear it for the girls
Living in the modern world
Let's hear it for the girls (Let's hear it for the girls)
Living in the modern world (Living in the modern world)

Lyrics:
[Intro/Whakaupoko]
He rā paki i Te Pōporo
Pōhutu i te wai pūāhuru
Ka hoki ngā mahara ki te ohinga o taku pāpā (O taku pāpā)
He rā paki

[Verse 1/Tahi Whiti]
Ka haea te kiri

[Verse 2/Rua Whiti]
Ahureinga o te aroha
Tā te tamariki mahi, he wāwāhi tahā

Ā tōna wā ka mōhio (Mōhio, mōhio)

[Verse 3/Toru Whiti]
Tai kato, kao mai ana te whai
Whakarongo rā ki ngā manu a Rehua

Kua hora ko te paki o Hewa, o Rūhī ki te ao mārama

[Verse 4/Whā Whiti]
E ngā uri o anamata
Ka rite rā koe ki a wai rā?
Ki ahau e noho nei, e pohewa ana?

Mauri ora (Ora, ora, ora, ora)
Kia hiwa (Hiwa, hiwa, hiwa, hiwa)
Mauri ora (Ora, ora, ora, ora)
Kia hiwa (Hiwa, hiwa, hiwa, hiwa)
Mauri ora (Ora, ora, ora, ora)
Kia hiwa (Hiwa, hiwa, hiwa, hiwa)

[Outro/Whakamutunga: Marlon Williams & Lorde]
I kitea rānеi te māramatanga e āta whāia ana?
Ka aro koe ki ngā tohu o tе taiao

Nā te tāwhaowhao ka mura
Me āta kī mai kua eke rā te wā
Nau mai rā, e Hine-i-te-awatea


Title: Hold My Liquor

Lyrics:
[Intro]
I hold my liquor
But this man can’t handle his weed
Dark and lonely now
On Chicago, south of town
I'm on to Indiana
I heard it in the radio now

[Chorus]
I can't handle no liquor
And these bitches can't handle me
I can't control my bitches
And my bitches they can't control me
You say you know me, my witches
But you really just know the old me

[Verse]
Bitch, I'm back out my coma
Wakin' up on your sofa
When I park my Range Rover
Slightly scratch your Corolla
Okay, I smashed your Corolla
I'm hanging on a hangover
Five years we been over
Ask me why I came over
One more hit and I can own ya
"Baby girl, he's a loner"
"Baby girl, he's a loner"
Late-night organ donor
After that, he disown ya
After that he's just hopeless
Soul mates become soulless
"When it's over it's over"
Bitch, I'm back out my coma


Title: Hold No Grudge

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Remember when we used to sing, baby, up in your room
Before your mother got home?
There was a sound to our innocence
Our voices were lovers in the same bed
Now I'm not sure how they would sound, isn't that sad?
Now that the ocean's all waves and the diamonds are blood
There's a new girl on your song
I didn't know that I could be replaced
Years ago, I tried to get a message to you
But I never heard back, I never heard back

[Pre-Chorus]
Where did we go wrong?
Our haven was always in the song
But just when I go to close the gates permanently
I realise that it isn't me

[Chorus]
No, I don't keep a list, can't hold a grudge
Don't you think that we both might've done some growing up?
Well, I know that some shit was said and done
But it's such a different world now, I can't hate anyone

[Post-Chorus]
Remember when we woke at dawn
Saw the silver sun in your old Citroën?
And remember when we took them on?
Stoners on the run, How the West Was Won

[Verse 2]
Remember when we used to swim, baby, no one around
Take off all our clothes?
And in the clear cold, we were born again
I used to count down to your birthday
Now I'm not sure if it's June or July, isn't that sad?

[Pre-Chorus]
Where did we go wrong?
Our haven was always in the song
But just when I go to close the gates permanently
I realise that it isn't me

[Chorus]
No, I don't keep a list, can't hold a grudge (Hold no grudge)
Don't you think that we both might've done some growing up?
Yeah, I know that some shit was said and done (Said and done)
But it's such a different world now, I can't hate anyone

[Post-Chorus]
Remember when we woke at dawn
Saw the silver sun in your old Citroën?
And remember when we took them on?
Stoners on the run, How the West Was Won

[Outro]
Acting my age, not my horoscope
Guess that's growing up
Now I'm sending you love and wishing you well
Wherever you are


Title: Homemade Dynamite

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
A couple rebel Top Gun pilots
Flying with nowhere to be
Don't know you super well
But I think that you might be the same as me
Behave abnormally

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side, tell you all my best lies
Yeah, awesome, right?
So let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side, tell you all my best lies
Seeing me rolling, showing someone else love
Dancing with our shoes off
Know I think you're awesome, right?

[Chorus]
Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite

[Verse 2]
Might get your friend to drive
But he can hardly see, ooh-ooh
We'll end up painted on the road, red and chrome
All the broken glass sparkling
I guess we're partying

[Pre-Chorus]
So let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side, tell you all my best lies
See me rolling, showing someone else love
Hands under your T-shirt
Know I think you're awesome, right?

[Chorus]
Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite

[Post-Chorus]
Now you know it's really gonna blow

[Chorus]
Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite

[Outro]
Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite

We were down in the hospital

Let's go back

It's time to go and kiss your oldest friends

Title: In The Air Tonight

Lyrics:
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
I've been waiting for this moment all my life, oh Lord
Can you feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord

Well if you told me you were drowning
I would not lend a hand
I've seen your face before my friend
Well I don't know if you know who I am
Well I was there and I saw what you did
I saw it with my own two eyes
Well you can wipe off the grin, I know where you've been
It's all been a pack of lies

I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
Oh, I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
And can you feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
But I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord, oh Lord

Well I remember, I remember don't worry
How could I ever forget, it's the first time
The last time we ever met
But I know the reason why you keep your silence up
No, you don't fool me
Cause the hurt doesn't show but the pain still grows
No stranger to you or me

I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
Well I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
And can you feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh
Well I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord, oh

And I can feel it in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord, oh Lord, yeah
Well I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord, yeah
I can feel it coming in the air tonight


Title: Invisible Ink*

Lyrics:
Lyrics from Live Performance at Newquay

[Verse]
Friends of mine
We're in the prime of our lives
I think it's high time your self preservation
Met my rising sun
Overnight
Strange overtones bring everything to life
Behind his back I use invisible ink
Color outside the lines with you

[Pre-Chorus]
Wide awake, I'm afraid in my body
Headless behavior, I want you to stop me
All of the sick twisted things I should swallow

[Chorus]
Let the bodies move, we'll sing the incantation
Fallin' right into you, choose pleasure over patience
Is this a mistake? The right thing to do?
Holdin' hands with my angels
I let them choose
Let the bodies move, give into this temptation
Fallin' right into you, choose pleasure over patience
Is this a mistake? The right thing to do?
Holdin' hands with my angels
I let them choose

[Post-Chorus]
Believe in my angels
I let them choose
Headless behavior


Title: Invisible Reflection

Lyrics:
A lonely sea sways every night
As you stay awake with the love of your life
I never let go of what we had
So it’s my time to explain
An invisible reflection stands still as I wake
Even if I try there’s no smile on my face
I wish i could let go
But all I see
Is the invisible reflection
Of me


Title: It’s Okay

Lyrics:
[Intro: Nine Inch Nails Sample]
I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

[Verse One]
I remember I was 10, I had my first encounters with depression
My notebook chalked with suicidal thoughts in lyrics pressed in
Ink on paper illustrations of a smith and Wesson
Review the past and repetition lead me to the present
Granted I’m feeling like many prefer the gift of absence
Do want a wake, I want cremation, I don’t need a casket
Fake family and friends around to claim they know me
Really, if they did, I wouldn’t be as stressed or feel so lonely
I only blame a few, I ain’t been reachin out
But then again, reactions, the reasons words fails to leave my mouth
Advil PM as a substitute for xans
Don’t make me angry, make me sleepy, plus sobriety’s the plan, to kick off 2018, with no mollies in my hand, not even swisher sweets, I’m feeling weaker as I cram
Information, in my cranium, I keep on pacing, and hit me since I dropped the “Dr.” peeps proceed to test my patience

[Hook]
(I hurt myself today)
Can you hear me now?
(I hurt myself today)
Don’t wanna scream or shout
(I hurt myself today)
Okay, never mind, it’s cool, it’s fine, I’ll be okay

[Verse Two]
Broken past will make you live your present life with no concerns about the future
Or even if you want one, when the stress is getting to ya
Recap all your qualities, the bad starts to abuse ya
The good becomes irrelevant and messes with your mood
And you telling yourself you’re worthless, your cursed and inadvertently introverted in person and no one knows that you’re hurting or cares to try to acknowledge the constant sorrows from all those times that you sprinted from hell and back and not wanting to wake tomorrow
But it's propane for the slow pain
Tryna leave it all is cocaine when what you wanted was a novacane
Mary Jane just don’t know your pain
Try to roll it all when some say that you cannot just smoke it all away

[Bridge]
I’m a low life, low class grade, fallin, no one catch me, ditching all my classmates, don’t wanna face, another face, cause my anxiety attacks me, packing all my bags to run away cause I don’t need another in the ashtray

[Hook]
(I hurt myself today)
Can you hear me now?
(I hurt myself today)
Don’t wanna scream or shout
(I hurt myself today)
Okay, never mind, it’s cool, it’s fine, I’ll be okay

[Bridge]
I’m a low life, low class grade, fallin, no one catch me, ditching all my classmates, don’t wanna face, another face, cause my anxiety attacks me, packing all my bags to run away cause I don’t need another in the ashtray (x5)

[Hook]
(I hurt myself today)
Can you hear me now?
(I hurt myself today)
Don’t wanna scream or shout
(I hurt myself today)
Okay, never mind, it’s cool, it’s fine, I’ll be okay

[Outro]
I hurt myself today (x5)
Okay, never mind, it's cool, it's fine, I'll be okay


Title: Ladder Song

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
No one knows where the ladder goes
You're gonna lose what you love the most
You're not alone in anything
You're not unique in dying
I feel estranged every now and then
Fall asleep reading science fiction
I wanna fly in your silver ship
Let my mama hang and my sister sit
It's on now
The days are long now
The ups and the sundowns
And a twisting mind
If I gotta go first
I'll do it on my terms
I'm tired of traitors always changing sides
They were friends of mine

[Verse 2]
Don't hang around once the promise breaks
Or you'll be there when the next one's made
Kiss the feet of a charlatan
Some imagine freedom
All the rest is predictable
Trying your hardest to melt the snow
Tie the knots to concentrate
Keep on pulling, that rope will break

[Verse 3]
We'll welcome the new age
Covered in warrior paint
Lights from the jungle to the sky
See now, a star bursts
Looks just like a blood orange
Don't it just make you wanna cry
Precious friend of mine?

[Verse 4]
Will I know when it's finally done?
This whole life's a hallucination
You're not alone in anything
You're not alone in trying to be


Title: Leader of a New Regime

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Wearing SPF 3000 for the ultraviolet rays
Made it to the island on the last of the outbound planes (Ah-ah)
Got a trunk full of Simone and Céline, and of course, my magazines
I'm gonna live out my days

[Verse 2]
Won't somebody, anybody, be the leader of a new regime?
Free the keepers of the burnt-out scene another day
Lust and paranoia reign supreme
We need the leader of a new regime


Title: Liability

Lyrics:
[Intro]
Go for it
One, two

[Verse 1]
Baby really hurt me, crying in the taxi
He don't wanna know me
Says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
Says it was poison
So I guess I'll go home
Into the arms of the girl that I love
The only love I haven't screwed up
She's so hard to please, but she's a forest fire
I do my best to meet her demands, play at romance
We slow dance in the living room
But all that a stranger would see
Is one girl swaying alone, stroking a cheek

[Chorus]
They say, "You're a little much for me
You're a liability
You're a little much for me"
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave
I'm a little much for e-a-na-na-na, everyone

[Verse 2]
The truth is I am a toy that people enjoy
Till all of the tricks don't work anymore
And then they are bored of me
I know that it's exciting, running through the night
But every perfect summer's eating me alive until you're gone
Better on my own

[Chorus]
They say, "You're a little much for me
You're a liability
You're a little much for me"
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave
I'm a little much for e-a-na-na-na, everyone

[Outro]
They're gonna watch me disappear into the sun
You're all gonna watch me disappear into the sun


Title: Life On Mars?

Lyrics:
It's a God awful small affair
To the girl with the mousey hair
But her mummy is yelling: No!
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is no where to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seats with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen
But the film is sadd'ning bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on

Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man!
Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man!
Wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?

It's on America's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibeza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog and clowns
But the film is a sadd'ning bore
Cause I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on

Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man!
Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man!
Wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?


Title: Lost Boys

Lyrics:
[Verse]
We were down at the hospital
Waiting for you to get well
..couldn't tell
In the ambulance you're laughing
..instead
We were down at the hospital
Thought about all the lies we tell
The real fun was when we were young, let's go back
(Back, back, back, back)

[Chorus]
It's time to come and kiss your oldest friends
It's time to let the lost boys take you in

[Bridge]
It's getting cold out
You wear yourself down
So please don't go out
You're looking dead behind the eyes
We'll stay at your house
Watch all those late shows on TV
I like it best when you're in here with me
And all the lost boys
We make a picture perfect team
Bruising sidewalks
With all the drumming of our feet
And boy, I promise
We'll never ever let you leave
Never let you leave


Title: Loveless

Title: Love Lockdown

Lyrics:
[Verse]
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So you never know, never, never know
Never know enough, 'til it's over love
'Til we lose control, system overload
Screaming, "No, no, no, n-nooo"
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See, I wanna move, but can't escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know

[Chorus]
So keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown
Now keep your lovе lockdown, you lose


Title: Magnets

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Never really felt bad about it
As we drank deep from the lie
'Cause I felt melting magnets, babe
The second I saw you through half-shut eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Smoke and sunset, off Mulholland
He was talking, I was wonderin' 'bout
You and that girl, she your girlfriend?
Face from heaven, bet the world she don't know
Pretty girls don't know the things that I know
Walk my way, I'll share the things that she won't

[Chorus]
Uh-oh, dancing past the point of no return
Let go, we can free ourselves of all we've learned
I love this secret language that we're speakin'
Say it to me, let's embrace the point of no return
Let's embrace the point of no return
Let's embrace the point of no return

[Verse 2]
Never really thought we would make it
We be thinking about what could have been
But we've had a record summer, can't turn it down, oh
Now I don't wanna see the end begin

[Pre-Chorus]
Smoke and sunset, off Mulholland
He was talking, I was wonderin' 'bout
You and that girl, she your girlfriend?
Face from heaven, bet the world she don't know
Pretty girls don't know the things that I know
Walk my way, I'll share the things that she won't

[Chorus]
Uh-oh, dancing past the point of no return
Let go, we can free ourselves of all we've learned
I love this secret language that we're speakin'
Say it to me, let's embrace the point of no return
Let's embrace the point of no return
Let's embrace the point of no return
Let's embrace the point of no return
Let's embrace the point of no return
(Let's embrace the point of no return)
(Let's embrace the point of no return)

Title: Mama Do

Lyrics:
Everynight I go
Everynight I go
Sneaking out the door
I lie a little more
Baby I'm helpless

There's something about the night
And the way it hides all the things I like
Little black butterflies
Deep inside me

What would my mama do
She knew about me and you?
What would my daddy say
She saw me hurt this way?

Why should I feel ashamed?
Feeling guilty at the mention of your name
Yeah, here we are again
It's nearly perfect

What would my mama do
She knew about me and you?
What would my daddy say
He saw me hurt this way?

Ka mahuta te rā, kua tata mai te ahungarua
Ko koe tonu tērā taku whakawairangi

[Pre-Chorus/Korihi Mua]
Kua roa e takahia ana tēnei huarahi
Atu i konei, ki hea atu rā?

[Chorus/Korihi]
He wā tōna ake haere a tā koe ki puoro kē atu
Ko te ao hurihuri tēnei e huri ana
E aua!
Kohore ana pea aku mata
Kohore ana pea aku mata (Mata)

[Bridge/Whakamatuatanga]
Kia pai mai rā
Kia pai mai rā
Taiāwhio ana i te ao hurihuri mō āke tonu e
Atu i konei, he aha te aha

[Chorus/Korihi]
Noho atu ki te hunga nā rātou koe i poipoi
Ko te ao hurihuri tēnei e huri ana
E aua!
Kohore ana pea aku mata
Kohore ana pea aku mata (Mata)


Title: Me And Julio Down By The Schoolyard

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Mama pyjama rolled outta bed
And she ran to the police station
When the papa found out, he began to shout
He started the investigation

[Pre-Chorus]
It was against the law, it was against the law
What my mama saw, it was against the law

[Verse 2]
And the mama looked down and she spit on the ground
Every time my name gets mentioned
And the papa said "Oh, if I get that boy
I'm gonna stick him in the house of detention"

[Chorus]
Well I'm on my way, I don't know where I'm going
And I'm on my way, it's taking to town but I don't know where
Goodbye to Rosie, queen of Corona
Seeing me and Julio down by the schoolyard
Seeing me and Julio down by the schoolyard

[Verse 3]
In a couple of days they're gonna take me away
When the press let the story leak
I have no reason, I have no reason
And we was all on the cover of Newsweek

[Chorus]
Well I'm on my way, I don't know where I'm going
I'm on my way, I'll take to town but I don't know where
Goodbye to Rosie, queen of Corona
Seeing me and Julio down by the schoolyard
Me and Julio down by the schoolyard
Seeing me and Julio down by the schoolyard
Oh, me and Ella in Golden Gate Park


Title: Meltdown

Lyrics:
[Produced by Stromae]

[Intro: Pusha T]
Lorde, meet King Push

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Life is like a costume party
Just cover the floors in Cavalli
Let's hide the hurt in a molly
We're all tryna be somebody else
You can't hide your tears in wealth
When your heart knows you hate yourself
It's all pain we felt
Just the way that the card's been dealt

[Refrain: Lorde]
Velvet rope, let us pass
Drop an olive in your glass
Put it on, a disguise
It's an opera of lies
Everyone on the run
Fifty feet all on the gas
Take him out, take him out
Gonna take him out, woah

[Pre-Chorus: Lorde]
We're the only theory they can't prove
And we don't have anything to lose

[Chorus: Lorde]
In my eyes, in my ears bring might
Love is only figured once in life
Tell the crowd, search the town
And we made it all melt down
It's a full meltdown

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Try to break her spirit so it shouldn't be surprisin'
We're here with no fear and gave her uprising
Gonna blend in with the bullies and the bureaucrats
Arrows pierce like lightning, choppers sound like thunder clap
Never will you stand, we gon' lay you down
Debonair and dapper kids comin' in to take the town
Try to restrain us, even though you trained us
We're better than you are, now we're gonna make you famous

[Refrain: Lorde]
Velvet rope, let us pass
Drop an olive in your glass
Put it on, a disguise
It's an opera of lies
Everyone on the run
Fifty feet all on the gas
Take him out, take him out
Gonna take him out, woah

[Bridge: Pusha T & Lorde]
We're all lookin' for status
Cristal sent over on gratis
Can't pretend we're not plastic
When these poker faces take practice
Who to trust? Who to love?
Who to run from? Who to hug?
Set fire to a government of thugs
Respect only comes from the money or your blood
We're out of sight, shadows of light
They're closing in and I know where we're goin'
But I don't know who I'll be

[Chorus: Lorde]
In my eyes, in my ears bring might
Love is only figured once in life
Tell the crowd, search the town
And we made it all melt down
It's a full meltdown
In my eyes, in my ears bring might
Love is only figured once in life
Tell the crowd, search the town
And we made it all melt down
It's a full meltdown

[Outro: Haim]
(I can hear, and see a ghost)
Was it meant to be?
(In my mind, I know)
'Cause I can't see
(And if you keep acting up)
I can't see
(I'm your undertow)
(I can hear, and see a ghost)
Was it meant to be?
(In my mind, I know)
I can't see
(And if you keep acting up)


Title: Million Dollar Bills

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
There's nothing I want
But money and time
Million dollar bills
And the tick-tick-tick-tick
There's nothing more cruel
Than only nine lives
Unlimited spines
Would do the trick-trick-trick-trick

[Chorus]
We could leave the house, leave the party, let the people know
Go drown the colours of our minds and watch the cars go

[Verse 2]
There's nothing as fun
As coming untied
And running with the kids
In the park-park-park-park
There's nothing that's hurt
Like letting you go
It's like a bird
Eyes
In the dark-dark-dark-dark

[Chorus]
We could leave the house, lead the party, let the people know
Go drown the colours of our minds and watch the cars go
It's not about just bein' out with the right people
'Cause we can get in trouble just by going free-flow

[Outro]
And now I'm letting you know
And now I'm letting you know
And now I'm letting you know
And now I'm letting you know


Title: Mood Ring

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I'm tryna blow bubbles, but inside
Can't seem to fix my mood
Today, it's as dark as my roots
If I, if I ever let them grow out (Ah-ah)
Now all of my oceans have riptides
Can't seem to find what's wrong
The whole world is letting me down
Don't you think the early 2000s seem so far away? (Ay-ay-ay-ay)

[Pre-Chorus]
Ladies, begin your sun salutations
Transcendental in your meditations (Love and light)
You can burn sage and I'll cleanse the crystals
We can get high, but only if the wind blows (Blows just right)

[Chorus]
I can't feel a thing
I keep looking at my mood ring
Tell me how I'm feeling
Floating away, floating away

[Verse 2]
I'm tryna get well from the inside
Plants and celebrity news, all the vitamins I consume
Let's fly somewherе eastern, they'll havе what I need (They'll have what I need)
Let's go

[Pre-Chorus]
Ladies, begin your sun salutations
Pluto in Scorpio generation (Love and light)
You can burn sage and I'll cleanse the crystals
We can get high, but only if the wind blows (Blows just right, ri-ri-ri-right)

[Chorus]
I can't feel a thing
I keep looking at my mood ring
Tell me how I'm feeling
Floating away, floating away
All the sad girls sing
We'll keep dancing 'til the mood rings
Tell us how we're feeling
Floating away, floating away

[Outro]
Take me to some kinda
Take me to some kinda
Take me to some kinda place (Anywhere)
Watch the sun set, look back on my life (Take me to some kinda)
I just wanna know, will it be alright? (Take me to some kinda)
Take me to some kinda place (Anywhere)


Title: My Happiness

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I see your shadow on the street now
I hear you push through the rusty gate
Click of your heels on the concrete
Waiting for a knock coming way too late
It seems an age since I've seen you
Countdown as the weeks trickle into days

[Bridge 1]
So you come in and put your bags down
I know there's something in the air
How can I do this to you right now
If you're over there when I need you here

[Chorus]
My happiness is slowly creeping back
Now you're at home
If it ever starts sinking in
It must be when you pack up and go

[Verse 2]
It seems an age since I've seen you
Countdown as the weeks trickle into days
I hope that time hasn't changed you
All I really want is for you to stay

[Bridge 1]
So you come in and put your bags down
I know there's something in the air
How can I do this to you right now
You're over there when I need you here

[Chorus]
My happiness is slowly creeping back
Now you're at home
If it ever starts sinking in
It must be when you pack up and go

[Bridge 2]
I know, I know, I know what is inside
I know, I know, I know what is inside
I know, I know, I know what is inside
I know, I know, I know what is inside

[Bridge 1]
You're over there when I need you here

[Chorus]
My happiness is slowly creeping back
Now you're at home
If it ever starts sinking in
It must be when you pack up and go

[Chorus]
My happiness is slowly creeping back
Now you're at home
If it ever starts sinking in
It must be when you pack up and go

[Bridge 2]
I know, I know, I know what is inside
I know, I know, I know what is inside
I know, I know, I know what is inside
I know, I know, I know what is inside

Title: NL (TBA)

Lyrics:
(Verse 1)
We're all going to a summer road trip
No more dancing for a week or two
Happy beaches and radiant lemonades
At our summer road trip (Under the nothern rays)
No more calm curtains for me or you
For a week or two

[Chorus]
Summertime, and the livin' is happy
Beaches are loving and the lemonades are high
Oh, your msister's caring and my friend is hot
Come fly with me honey, don't you fall
Icarus will never be a fairytail I want

(Post-Chorus)
That's why the nothern lights won't put out our fire

(Verse 2)
I can't wait to touch you
Waiting in anticipation
This just can't be summer love, you'll see
This just can't be summer love

(Pre-Chorus)
'Cause you were mine for the summer
Now we know it's nearly over
Feels like summer sunshine is dying
But nothern lights began shining
You were my summer love
You always will be my summer love

(Bridge)
I wish they all could be ...
I wish they all could be ...
I wish they all could be...
In love like me

[Chorus]
Summertime, and the livin' is happy
Beaches are loving and the lemonades are high
Oh, your brother's caring and my mother's here
So full the moon, is he tonight
We'll be forever engraved in those northern lights

(Verse 3)
Me and some curtains from under the northern rays
Had a band and we tried real hard
C quit, Ive laughing and we were happy
Now I can't quit dancing, hold me forever

[Outro]
Oh the summer of 2019
Under the northern lights


Title: No Better

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
We roll in every summer when there's strength in our numbers
And your breath's hot and gross, but I kiss you like a lover
Legs stick to the seats of the car someone grew into
I forget the knowledge from the lessons that I went to
And Jamie picks fights, but they're weak and short-lived
Because no one can be bothered when it's humid like this
And we roll in every summer like it's shameful to be underneath
The ceiling or a roof, try come out and steal our thunder

[Verse 2]
Now the days are getting cooler and the burning of our limbs
Doesn't happen quite as bad and the burn is just skin
Deep in the fantasies and dreams of the winter
Like the movies that we watched to pretend it wasn't winter
And everywhere we go, I can feel the subtle taste
Of the deeds outgrown and the welcome overstayed
And you're no better at swimming than you were in the beginning
But you come over at night and we practise all the breathing

[Chorus]
Go all the way, have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days, do your thing, do it well
This will take you down
Go all the way, have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days, do your thing, do it well
This will take you down

[Bridge]
I'll pull the trig if I want to
I'll pull the trick and it comes true
I'm chewing gum and it's killin' you
We're gettin' dead and it's the right way to do it
I see you happy in the front seat
I see you with all of your front teeth
You're allergic, but you never said
We're gettin' dead and it's the right way

[Chorus]
Go all the way, have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days, do your thing, do it well
This will take you down
Go all the way, have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days, do your thing, do it well
This will take you down

Title: Nobody Move*

Lyrics:
[Chorus: Lorde]
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Nobody move, nobody gets hurt
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Nobody move, nobody move, nobody
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Nobody move, nobody gets hurt
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Nobody move, nobody move, nobody


Title: Oceanic Feeling

Lyrics:
[Intro]
It's a blue day
We could jump Bulli
When I hit that water
When it holds me
I think about my father
Doin' the same thing
When he was a boy
When he was a boy
It's a blue day
We could go fishing
You'll catch the big one
Ah

[Verse 1]
Slidin' the knife under the skin
Grateful for this offering
And all the livin' things under the sun
Under the sun

[Verse 2]
Little brother, I think you're an angel
I see your silver chain levitate
When you're kickflipping
Baby boy, you're super cool
I know you're scared, so was I
But all will be revealed in time (Time, time)

[Verse 3]
Oh, look, the rays are in the bay now
Can you hear the waves and the cicadas all around?
I can make anything real
Brain so hot, it's a summer body
Every day is blue and never cloudy
Don't look down
I can make anything real

[Verse 4]
In the future
If I have a daughter
Will she have my waist
Or my widow's peak?
My dreamer's disposition or my wicked streak?

[Verse 5]
Will she split a tab with her lover?
And laugh at the stars like her mother
When she was a girl?
When she was a girl?

[Refrain]
Now the cherry-black lipstick's gathering dust in a drawer
I don't need her anymore
'Cause I got this power
I just had to breathe (Breathe out, breathe out, breathe out, breathe out)
And tune in (Tune in, tune in, tune in, tune in)
I just had to breathe (Breathe out, breathe out, breathe out, breathe out)
And tune in (Tune in, tune in, tune in, tune in)
I just had to breathe
And tune in
I just had to breathe
And tune in
I just had to breathe

[Outro: Lorde & Marlon Williams]
Oh, was enlightenment found?
No, but I'm tryin', takin' it one year at a time
Oh, oh, can you hear the sound?
It's shimmerin' higher
On the beach, I'm buildin' a pyre
(Use the wood brought in by the tide)
I know you'll show me how, I'll know when it's time
To take off my robes and step into the choir


Title: Ode to Lorde

Lyrics:
Rolling Stone named you the
Girl Who Broke All the Rules,

but Ella, you taught us there
were no rules to begin with.

They say you dress like a Goth and
dance like a puppet struck by lightning

and you say to them, yes, I do. I am
allowed to. I am allowed to be whatever

version of myself I want to be today.
When pop culture took a magic eraser

to your rigid cheeks for their magazines,
you told them your skin was not theirs to edit.

The next day, I swear I didn’t wear any cover-up
to school at all and I still felt beautiful. Lorde,

my little cousin heard you say you were a feminist
on the radio, and now her and a gaggle of 5th graders

call themselves “Club Confident.” From you, millions
of girls learned it is cool to be on each other’s team.

How revolutionary; busting the system that
taught us to see every ponytail as competition

and that we are all supposed to like pink but
it can only be one of our favorite colors.

Title: Perfect Places

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Every night, I live and die
Feel the party to my bones
Watch the wasters blow the speakers
Spill my guts beneath the outdoor light
It's just another graceless night
I hate the headlines and the weather
I'm 19 and I'm on fire
But when we're dancing I'm alright
It's just another graceless night

[Pre-Chorus]
Are you lost enough?
Have another drink, get lost in us
This is how we get notorious, oh
'Cause I don't know
If they keep tellin' me where to go
I'll blow my brains out to the radio, oh

[Chorus]
All of the things we're taking
'Cause we are young and we're ashamed
Send us to perfect places
All of our heroes fading
Now I can't stand to be alone
Let's go to perfect places

[Verse 2]
Every night, I live and die
Meet somebody, take 'em home
Let's kiss and then take off our clothes
It's just another graceless night

[Chorus]
All of the things we're taking
'Cause we are young and we're ashamed
Send us to perfect places
All of our heroes fading
Now I can't stand to be alone
Let's go to perfect places

[Outro]
All the nights spent off our faces
Trying to find these perfect places
What the fuck are perfect places anyway?
All the nights spent off our faces
Trying to find these perfect places
What the fuck are perfect places anyway?
All the nights spent off our faces
Trying to find these perfect places
What the fuck are perfect places anyway?


Title: Piece of Mind

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Lorde]
Seems to rise within pinpoint underpinned
Divided into a piece of mind that's prescribed for a later time
Guess who's right yeah and no one proves
Listening for proof you cannot use

[Verse 2: Lorde]
Despondents intertwined in that moment unrealized
From hindsight it all comes clear passing through so insincere
Irrelevant to any gaze conceived to judge from older age

[Outro: Lorde]
Intended to serve us, no love questioned from
Those that hide, so hide wants to ask, why at all, so small


Title: Precious Metals

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
The Chanel, the Dior and the Prada
Take it home, make a fire in the garden
Sundance kids, so godless
One day it's gonna be not like this
Black sand on all our beaches
Witchcraft, split lip and a bee sting
And what I really wanna know is

[Chorus]
Do I look like a fool?
'Cause I must be a fool
To hold on to precious metals like I do
Do, I do
To hold on to precious metals like I do
I do, do

[Verse 2]
The Chanel, the Dior, and the Prada
Give my best to the ones that are bothered
Take a flight trip to Jakarta
All the kids at the shows make it louder
All of the feelings and all of the tears are going
All of the secrets and all of the schemes that don't go my way
I wish you would come back, then you want to run back
Come back, bet you want to come back
And I'll find you

[Chorus]
Do I look like a fool?
'Cause I must be a fool
To hold on to precious metals like I do (Ah)
Do (Ah), I do (Ah)
To hold on to precious metals like I do (Ah)
I do (Ah), do (Ah)

[Outro]
(Ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah)


Title: Reaper

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
It's nice to hear your voice again
I pushed you so far down and I let you sink through the drain
There's a claw on my shoulder
And she's saying the obvious
"You know eventually you're gonna have to be a provider, too"

[Verse 2]
She's coming closer, I can feel her breathe
I keep forgetting that I'll have a family
If I listen in with my hands cupped and on my knees
I can hear the single obnoxious sigh of relief

[Chorus]
I'm born to be somebody, then somebody comes from me
I'll tell you about the Rabbit Moon and when to keep walking
I'll spare you pain, I can feel my shame come through that door
I can't fuck it up if it's not there at all

[Chorus]
I'm born to be somebody, then somebody comes from me
I'll show you where I did swim team and drive to Dunwoody
I'll spare you pain, I can feel my shame creep through the floor
I can't fuck it up if it's not there at all
I can't fuck it up if it's not there at all


Title: Ribs

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
The drink you spilt all over me
"Lover's Spit" left on repeat
My mum and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy, getting old

[Pre-Chorus]
We can talk it so good
We can make it so divine
We can talk it good
How you wish it would be all the time

[Chorus]
The drink you spilt all over me
"Lover's Spit" left on repeat
My mum and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy, getting old
The drink you spilt all over me
"Lover's Spit" left on repeat
My mum and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy, getting old

[Verse 2]
This dream isn't feeling sweet
We're reeling through the midnight streets
And I've never felt more alone
It feels so scary, getting old

[Pre-Chorus]
We can talk it so good
We can make it so divine
We can talk it good
How you wish it would be all the time

[Chorus]
This dream isn't feeling sweet
We're reeling through the midnight streets
And I've never felt more alone
It feels so scary, getting old
This dream isn't feeling sweet
We're reeling through the midnight streets
And I've never felt more alone
It feels so scary, getting old

[Bridge]
I want 'em back, I want 'em back
The minds we had, the minds we had
How all the thoughts, how all the thoughts
Moved 'round our heads, moved 'round our heads
I want 'em back, I want 'em back
The minds we had, the minds we had
It's not enough to feel the lack
I want 'em back, I want 'em back
I want 'em

[Refrain]
You're the only friend I need
(You're the only friend I need)
Sharing beds like little kids
(Sharing beds like little kids)
And laughing till our ribs get tough
(Laughing till our ribs get tough)
But that will never be enough
(But that will never be enough)
You're the only friend I need
(You're the only friend I need)
Sharing beds like little kids
(Sharing beds like little kids)
And laughing till our ribs get tough
(Laughing till our ribs get tough)
But that will never be enough
(But that will never be enough)

[Outro]
But that will never be enough
But that will never be enough
But that will never be enough
But that will never be enough

Title: Royals

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address, in the torn-up town
No postcode envy

[Pre-Chorus]
But every song's like gold teeth, Gold Goose, singin' in the bathroom
Grass stains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like gold ring, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

[Chorus]
And we'll never be royals
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of love
Let me be your ruler, you can call me Queen Bee
And baby I'll rule (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy

[Verse 2]
My friends and I, we've cracked the code
We count our dollars on the train to the party
And everyone who knows us knows that we're fine with this
We didn't come from money

[Pre-Chorus]
But every song's like gold teeth, Gold Goose, singin' in the bathroom
Grass stains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like gold ring, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

[Chorus]
And we'll never be royals
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of love
Let me be your ruler, you can call me Queen Bee
And baby I'll rule (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy

[Bridge]
(Ooh ooh oh)
We're bigger than we ever dreamed, and I'm in love with being queen
(Ooh ooh oh)
Life is great without a care
We aren't caught up in your love affair

[Chorus]
And we'll never be royals
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of love
Let me be your ruler, you can call me Queen Bee
And baby I'll rule (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy


Title: Royals Condensed for time

Lyrics:
[Verse]
And everybody's like
Fancy stuff and valuable things
And bla bla bla, excessive spending
We don't care
We're from a shitty town and we're poor


Title: Secrets from a Girl (Who’s Seen it All)

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Dancing with my girls, only having two drinks, then leaving
It's a funny thing, thought you’d never gain self-control
Guess it's been a while since you last said sorry
Crying in the dark at your best friends' parties
You’ve had enough, gotta turn the lights up, go home

[Pre-Chorus]
Couldn't wait to turn fifteen
Then you blink and it's been ten years
Growing up a little at a time, then all at once
Everybody wants the best for you
But you gotta want it for yourself, my love
You can take 'em if you want 'em, these are just

[Chorus]
Secrets from a girl who's seen it all
Secrets from a girl who's seen it
Secrets from a girl
Secrets from a girl who's seen it all
Secrets from a girl (Secrets from a girl)
Secrets from a girl who’s seen it all

[Verse 2]
’Member all the hurt you would feel when you weren't desired? (Doing anything for more touch)
’Member what you thought was grief before you got the call?
Baby girl, no one's gonna feel the pain for you
You're gonna love again, so just try staying open
And when the time comes, you'll fall
Yeah, when the time comes, you’ll fall

[Pre-Chorus]
Your dreams and inner visions
All your mystical ambitions, they won't let you down
Do your best to trust all the rays of light
Everybody wants the best for you
But you've gotta want it for yourself, my love
Couldn't wait to turn fifteen, then you just go

[Chorus]
Secrets from a girl who's seen it all
Secrets from a girl who's seen it
Secrets from a girl
Secrets from a girl who's seen it all
Secrets from a girl (Secrets from a girl)
Secrets from a girl who's seen it all

[Spoken Outro: Robyn]
Welcome to Sadness
The temperature is unbearable until you face it
Thank you for flying with Strange Airlines, I will be your tour guide today
Your emotional baggage can be picked up at carousel number two
Please be careful so it doesn't fall onto someone you love
When we've reached your final destination, I will leave you to it
You'll be fine
I'm just gonna show you in and, um...
You can stay as long as you need to get familiar with the feeling
And then when you're ready, I'll be outside, and...
We can go look at the sunrise by euphoria, mixed with existential vertigo?
Cool...

Allow me to set the scene
When I met you, I'd never done ecstasy
Just a girl with a dream
Remember?
Back then I still had wisdom teeth
In my hair, just a girl in the night
In the bed I would still fake a scream of pleasure
But can you see now?

[Pre-Chorus]
That girl is a woman so call a stretch limousine
For her desires and demons, you don't know what she's seen
There are ghosts that she hides
But you know all she wants is to get down

[Chorus]
Every night, the silver moon, it changes
Can you say the same? Do you stay the same?
Can you change with me? Can I be honest?
Can I press where it hurts, my baby?
I wanna ride with you

[Verse 2]
Baby, we love in extremes
Every touch like a prayer
When we're there, can't compare
Tell me why do we need to suffer?
Feels like the AC is broken
I said something that touched a nerve
You blow up and I go dark
The way my mother does
The angels cry for us
'Cause they can see now

[Pre-Chorus]
That girl is a woman so call a stretch limousine
For her desires and demons, you don't know what she's seen
There are ghosts that she hides
But you know all she wants is to get down

[Chorus]
Every night, the silver moon, it changes
Can you say the same? Do you stay the same?
Can you change with me? Can I be honest?
Can I press where it hurts, my baby?
I wanna ride with you
I wanna ride with you

[Bridge]
Baby, when the moon is gleamin'
With your heart open, breathe in
I would never dream of leavin'
Baby, when the moon is gleamin'
With your heart open, breathe in
I would never dream of leavin'
I would never dream of leavin'

[Outro]
I wanna ride with you
I wanna ride with you


Title: Sober

Lyrics:
[Intro]
Night, midnight, lose my mind
Night, midnight, lose my mind
Night, midnight, lose my mind
(When you get to my high, when you get to)
Night, midnight

[Verse 1]
Oh God, I'm clean out of air
In my lungs, it's all gone
Played it so nonchalant
It's time we danced with the truth
Move alone with the truth
Ooh (Hey)
We're sleeping through all the days
I'm acting like I don't see
Every ribbon you used to tie yourself to me

[Pre-Chorus]
But my hips have missed your hips
So let's get to know the kicks
Will you sway with me?
Go astray with me?
(Ah-ha)

[Chorus]
We're king and queen of the weekend
Ain't a pill that could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
Uh, when you dream with a fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
These are the games of the weekend
We pretend that we just don't care, but we care
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
Uh, when you dream with a fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober?)

[Verse 2]
Oh, God, I'm closing my teeth
Around this liquour-wet lime
Midnight, lose my mind
I know you're feeling it too
Can we keep up with the ruse?
Ah ah (Hey)
B-bodies all through my house
I know this story by heart:
Jack and Jill get fucked up and possessive
When it get dark

[Pre-Chorus]
But my hips have missed your hips
So let's get to know the kicks
Will you sway with me?
Go astray with me?
(Ah-ha)

[Chorus]
We're king and queen of the weekend
Ain't a pill that could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
Uh, when you dream with a fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
These are the games of the weekend
We pretend that we just don't care, but we care
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
Uh, when you dream with a fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober?)

[Bridge]
Midnight, we're fading
Till daylight, we're jaded
We know that it's over
In the morning, you'll be dancing with
All the heartache and the treason
The fantasies of leaving
But we know that, when it's over
In the morning, you'll be dancing with us
(Midnight, lose my mind, midnight, lose my mind)
Oh, dancing with us
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
Oh, you'll be dancing with us
(Can you feel it? Can you feel it?)
Dancing with us, us
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
Us

[Outro]
When you get to my high (Midnight, lose my mind)
When you get to my (Midnight, lose my mind)


Title: Sober II (Melodrama)

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
You asked if I was feeling it, I'm psycho high
Know you won't remember in the morning when I speak my mind
Lights are on and they've gone home, but who am I?
Oh, how fast the evening passes
Cleaning up the champagne glasses
We told you this was melodrama
(Oh, how fast the evening passes
Cleaning up the champagne glasses)
Our only wish is melodrama
(Oh, how fast the evening passes
Cleaning up the champagne glasses)

[Verse 2]
And the terror and the horror
When we wonder why we bother, whoa, whoa
And the terror and the horror
God, I wonder why we bother, whoa, whoa
All the glamour and the trauma
And the fuckin' melodrama, whoa, whoa
All the gun fights and the lime lights
And the holy sick divine nights, whoa
(Holy sick divine nights, whoa)
They'll talk about us, all the lovers
How we kiss and kill each other, whoa
They'll talk about us, and discover
How we kissed and killed each other, whoa
(And we'll tell them)

[Refrain]
We told you this was melodrama
You wanted something that we offer
We told you this was melodrama
You wanted something that we offer
We told you this was melodrama
You wanted something that we offer
We told you this was melodrama
You wanted something that we offer

[Outro]
We told you this was melodrama
We told you this was melodrama
We told you this was melodrama
We told you this was melodrama
We told you this was melodrama


Title: Solar Power

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I hate the winter, can't stand the cold
I tend to cancel all the plans (So sorry, I can't make it)
But when the heat comes, something takes a hold
Can I kick it? Yeah, I can
[Pre-Chorus]
My cheeks in high colour, overripe peaches
No shirt, no shoes, only my features
My boy behind me, he's taking pictures
Lead the boys and girls onto the beaches
Come one, come all, I'll tell you my secrets
I'm kinda like a prettier Jesus

[Chorus]
Forget all of thе tears that you've cried
It's ovеr (Over, over, over, over)
It's a new state of mind
Are you coming, my baby?

[Verse 2]
Acid green, aquamarine
The girls are dancing in the sand
And I throw my cellular device in the water
Can you reach me? No, you can't (Aha)

[Pre-Chorus]
My cheeks in high colour, overripe peaches
No shirt, no shoes, only my features
My boy behind me, he's taking pictures (He's taking pictures)
Lead the boys and girls onto the beaches
Come one, come all, I'll tell you my secrets
I'm kinda like a prettier Jesus

[Chorus]
Turn it on in a new kind of bright
It's solar (Solar, solar, solar, solar, solar)
Come on and let the bliss begin
Blink three times when you feel it kicking in

[Outro]
That solar-olar-olar power
Solar-olar-olar power
Solar-olar-olar power
Solar-olar-olar power
Solar-olar-olar power
Solar-olar-olar power

Title: Somebody Else

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
So I heard you found somebody else
And at first, I thought it was a lie
I took all my things that make sounds
The rest I can do without

[Chorus]
I don't want your body
But I hate to think about you with somebody else
Our love has gone cold
You're intertwining your soul with somebody else
I'm looking through you
While you're looking through your phone
And then leaving with somebody else
No, I don't want your body
But I'm picturing your body with somebody else

[Verse 2]
And c'mon baby, I know
And this ain't the last time that I'll see your face
And c'mon baby, I know
You said you'd find someone to take my place

[Pre-Chorus]
I just don't believe that you have got it in you
Cause we are just gonna keep "doin' it" and every time
I start to believe in anything you're saying
I'm reminded that I should be getting over it

[Chorus]
I don't want your body
But I hate to think about you with somebody else
Our love has gone cold
You're intertwining your soul with somebody else
I'm looking through you
While you're looking through your phone
And then leaving with somebody else
No, I don't want your body
But I'm picturing your body with somebody else

[Bridge]
Get someone you love?
Get someone you need?
Oh, fuck that, get money
Oh, I can't give you my soul cause we're never alone
Get someone you love?
Get someone you need?
Oh, fuck that, get money
Oh, I can't give you my soul cause we're never alone
Get someone you love?
Get someone you need?
Oh, fuck that, get money
Oh, I can't give you my soul cause we're never alone
Get someone you love?
Get someone you need?
Oh, fuck that, get money
Oh, I can't give you my soul cause we're never alone

[Chorus]
I don't want your body
But I hate to think about you with somebody else
Our love has gone cold
You're intertwining your soul with somebody else
Oh, I'm looking through you
While you're looking through your phone
And then leaving with somebody else
No, I don't want your body
But I'm picturing your body with somebody else

[Outro]
I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know


Title: ​spring

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
"How are you?"
I guess we're not even starting with a "Hey"
And right you just look like you're the same
But your face is so pretty
Guess I'll give it a shot
And so I gave it a shot
It's a dream
I can talk to you
And I've only known you for weeks
We're telling secrets through the night and I feel like a teen
Maybe you're not as bad as you seem
As you seem

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I told you something that I never said before
Like how I was terrified in California
And you told me the same
And that's when I knew this wasn't a game anymore
Like how your bones almost came back and took your life
Or how you couldn't even trust yourself to stay alive
But right now, you feel same to me
I can go to you, and I'm so much better, it seems

[Chorus]
You feel like spring
And I love everything that you bring
And I feel like I can tell you anything
But I couldn't bring myself to say "I love you"
So I guess I'm gonna sing
About all of the good things that I miss about you

[Verse 2]
Your voice
It cuts through my worst days like a sword
And your stories about your father, they made me swore
But I'm so happy that you got away
You got away
And we flew
I felt faster than an arrow with you
And I would drown all my friendships just to get a view
They'd paint us and hang us in the Louvre
Down the back, but who cares?
Still the Louvre

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I told you something that I never said before
Like how my family never talks about the boys
And you told me the same
And that's when I knew this wasn't a game anymore
Like how you had to leave your own mother's home
And stay with that man that you call your father
You said it was the worst mistake of your life
And I hope I was safe to you

[Chorus]
You feel like spring
And I love everything that you bring
And I feel like I can tell you anything
But I couldn't bring myself to say "I love you"
So I guess I'm gonna sing
About all of the good things that I miss about you

[Bridge]
I apologize
But I didn't wanna ruin
Because for a moment, I felt like I was in love
And now we're ruined anyway, 'cause you won't talk
And my love has gone right down the drain
And boy, I hope you're feeling strong everyday
And I hope that we can talk someday
Talk someday

[Chorus]
But you feel like spring
Warm, stormy and we were blooming
And I love everything that you bring
But I'm terrified anyway
You were always so much smarter than me
And I feel like I can tell you anything
But I couldn't bring myself to say "I love you" then
So I guess I'm gonna sing
About all of the good things that I miss about you


Title: Still Sane

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Today is my birthday and I'm riding high
Hair is dripping, hiding that I'm terrified
But this is summer, playing dumber than in fall
Everything I say falls right back into everything

[Refrain]
I'm not in the swing of things
But what I really mean is
Not in the swing of things yet

[Verse 2]
Riding around on the bikes, we're still sane
I won't be her, tripping over onstage
Hey, it's all cool
I still like hotels, but I think that'll change
Still like hotels and my newfound fame
Hey, promise I can stay good

[Pre-Chorus]
(Everything feels right)
I'm little, but I'm coming for the crown
I'm little, but I'm coming for you
(Chase paper, get by)
I'm little but I'm coming for the title held by everyone who's up

[Chorus]
All work and no play never made me lose it
All business, all day keeps me up a level
All work and no play keeps me on the new shit, yeah
All work and no play, let me count the bruises
All business, all day keeps me up a level
All work and no play, lonely on that new shit, yeah
Yeah

[Bridge]
Only bad people live to see
Their likeness set in stone
Only bad people live to see
Their likeness set in stone
What does that make me?

[Refrain]
I'm not in the swing of things
But what I really mean is
Not in the swing of things yet
I'm not in the swing of things
But what I really mean is
Not in the swing of things yet

[Chorus]
All work and no play never made me lose it
All business, all day keeps me up a level
All work and no play keeps me on the new shit, yeah


Title: Stoned at the Nail Salon

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Got a wishbone drying on the windowsill in my kitchen
Just in case I wake up and realise I've chosen wrong
I love this life that I have
The vine hanging over the door
And the dog who comes when I call
But I wonder sometimes what I'm missing

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, my hot blood's been burning for so many summers now
It's time to cool it down, wherever that leads

[Chorus]
'Cause all the beautiful girls, they will fade like the roses
And all the times they will change, it'll all come around
I don't know
Maybе I'm just stoned at the nail salon
Maybe I'm just stonеd at the nail salon again

[Verse 2]
Got a memory of waiting in your bed wearing only my earrings
We'd go dancing all over the landmines under our town
But the sun has to rise
When it does, we'll divide up the papers
Two former hell-raisers
I'm still crazy for you, babe

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, my hot blood's been burning for so many summers now
It's time to cool it down, wherever that leads

[Chorus]
'Cause all the music you loved at sixteen you'll grow out of
And all the times they will change, it'll all come around
I don't know
Maybe I'm just
Maybe I'm just stoned at the nail salon again

[Bridge]
Oh, make it good
Oh, make it good
I'd ride and I'd ride on the carousel
'Round and 'round forever if I could
But it's time to cool it down
Whatever that means

[Chorus]
Spend all the evenings you can with the people who raised you
'Cause all the times they will change, it'll all come around
I don't know
Maybe I'm just stoned at the nail salon
Maybe I'm just stoned at the nail salon again


Title: Strong Enough

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Danielle]
God, I feel like hell tonight
Tears of rage I cannot fight
I'd be the last to help you understand
Are you strong enough to be my man?
My man?

[Verse 2: Este]
Nothing's true and nothing's right
So let me be alone tonight
Cause you can't change the way I am
Are you strong enough to be my man?

[Pre-Chorus: Este]
Lie to me
I promise I'll believe
Lie to me
But, please, don't leave

[Verse 3: Lorde]
I have a face I cannot show
I make the rules up as I go
It's try and love me if you can
Are you strong enough to be my man?

[Chorus: Lorde]
When I've shown you that I just don't care
When I'm throwing punches in the air
When I'm broken down and I can't stand
Will you be man enough to be my man?

[Hook: Lorde and Este]
Lie to me
I promise I'll believe
Lie to me
But, please, don't leave

[Outro: Danielle, Este, Lorde]
Are you strong enough to be my man?
Are you strong enough to be my man?
Are you strong enough to be my man?
Are you strong enough to be my man?
Are you strong enough to be my man?
Are you strong enough to be my man?
Are you strong enough to be my man?


Title: Supercut

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
In my head
I play a supercut of us
All the magic we gave off
All the love we had and lost
And in my head
The visions never stop
These ribbons wrap me up
But when I reach for you
There's just a supercut

[Pre-Chorus]
In your car, the radio up
In your car, the radio up
We keep trying to talk about us
I'm someone you maybe might love
I'll be your quiet afternoon crush
Be your violent overnight rush
Make you crazy over my touch

[Chorus]
But it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us
Oh, it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us

[Verse 2]
So I fall
Into continents and cars
All the stages and thе stars
I turn all of it
To just a supercut

[Refrain]
'Cause in my head (In my hеad, I do everything right)
When you call (When you call, I'll forgive and not fight)
Because ours are the moments I play in the dark
We were wild and fluorescent, come home to my heart, uh

[Pre-Chorus]
In your car, the radio up
In your car, the radio up
We keep trying to talk about us
Slow motion, I'm watching our love
I'll be your quiet afternoon crush
Be your violent overnight rush
Make you crazy over my touch

[Chorus]
But it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us
Oh, it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us
But it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us
Oh, it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us

[Refrain]
'Cause in my head, in my head, I do everything right
When you call, I'll forgive and not fight
All the moments I play in the dark
Wild, fluorescent, come home to my heart, uh
'Cause in my head (In my head, I do everything right)
When you call (When you call, I'll forgive and not fight)
Because ours are the moments I play in the dark
We were wild and fluorescent, come home to my heart, uh
'Cause in my head (In my head, I do everything right)
When you call (When you call, I'll forgive and not fight)
Because ours are the moments I play in the dark
We were wild and fluorescent, come home to my heart, uh

[Outro]
In my head, I do everything right
In my head, I do everything right

Title: Sway

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Desert, middle of winter
My feet, they know America
My cheek, frozen window
My eyes eat up a handful
Gaining and then I'm leaving
Just as it starts to happen

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel the distance
But then I remember being kids
And swaying in the light of the disco ball
Shut my eyes, I'm still swaying in the light of the disco ball

[Verse 2]
Oak Park, it's all melting
My friend shows me everything
We run around inside her high school
The hoop in my stomach gets dunked
Over and over, think of my boys
They're in class stirring up another continent
Right now I feel them missing

[Chorus]
But then I remember being held
And swinging in the light of the disco ball
Swinging in the light of the disco ball
(Time to go)
Back there now, I'm swaying the light of the disco ball
I'm still swinging in the light of the disco ball
Back there now, I'm swaying in the light of the disco ball
(Time to go)

[Outro]
Thought I'd be forever in the light that way
Thought I would be swaying now
Thought I'd be forever in the light that way
Thought I would be swaying now
Thought I'd be forever in the light that way
Thought I would be swaying now, be swaying now
Thought I'd be forever in the light that way
Thought I would be swaying now
Thought I'd be forever in the light that way
Thought I would be swaying now
Thought I'd be forever in the light that way
Thought I would be swaying now
Thought I'd be forever in the light that way
Thought I would be swaying now, would be swaying now
Thought I'd be forever in the light that way
Thought I would be swaying now
Thought I'd be forever in the light that way
Thought I would be swaying now
Thought I'd be forever in the light that way
Thought I would be swaying now
Thought I'd be forever in the light that way
Thought I would be swaying now
Thought I'd be forever in the light that way


Title: Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)

Lyrics:
Sweet dreams are made of these
Who am I to disagree?
Travel the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something
Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused

Sweet dreams are made of these
Who am I to disagree?
Travel the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something
Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused

Title: Swingin Party

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Bring your own lampshade, somewhere there's a party
Here it's never ending, can't remember when it started
Pass around the lampshade, there'll be plenty enough room in jail

[Chorus]
If being wrong's a crime, I'm serving forever
If being strong's your kind, then I need help here with this feather
If being afraid is a crime, we hang side by side
At the swingin' party down the line

[Verse 2]
Pound the prairie pavement, losing proposition
Quitting school and going to work and never going fishing
Water all around, I never learned how to swim now

[Chorus]
If being wrong's a crime, I'm serving forever
If being strong's your kind, then I need help here with this feather
If being afraid is a crime, we hang side by side
At the swingin' party down the line
At the swingin' party down the line

[Verse 1]
Bring your own lampshade, somewhere there's a party
Here it's never ending, can't remember when it started
Pass around the lampshade, there'll be plenty enough room in jail

[Chorus]
If being wrong's a crime, I'm serving forever
If being strong is what you want
Then I need help here with this feather
If being afraid is a crime, we hang side by side
At the swingin' party down the line
At the swingin' party down the line

Take, take me home

Title: Take Me to the River

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I don't know why I love her like I do
All the changes you put me through
Take my money, my cigarettes
I haven't seen the worst of it yet

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna know that you'll tell me
I love to stay

[Chorus]
Take me to the river, drop me in the water
Take me to the river, dip me in the water
Washing me down, washing me down

[Verse 2]
I don't know why you treat me so bad
Think of all the things we could've had
Love is a notion that I can't forget
My sweet sixteen I would never regret

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna know that you'll tell me
I love to stay

[Chorus]
Take me to the river, drop me in the water
Push me in the river, dip me in the water
Washing me down, washing me

[Bridge]
Hug me, squeeze me, love me, tease me
Till I can't, till I can't, I can't take no more

[Chorus]
Dip me in the water, drop me in the river
Push me in the water, drop me in the river
Washing me down, washing me down

[Verse 3]
I don't know why I love you like I do
All the trouble you put me through
Sixteen candles there on my wall
And here am I, the biggest fool of them all

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna know that you'll tell me
I love to stay

[Chorus]
Take me to the river and drop me in the water
Dip me in the river and drop me in the water
Washing me down, washing me down

None


Title: Team

Lyrics:
[Intro]
Wait 'til you're announced
We've not yet lost all our graces
The hounds will stay in chains
Look upon Your Greatness and she'll send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out

[Verse 1]
Call all the ladies out, they're in their finery
A hundred jewels on throats
A hundred jewels between teeth
Now bring my boys in, their skin in craters like the moon
The moon we love like a brother, while he glows through the room
Dancin' around the lies we tell
Dancin' around big eyes as well
Even the comatose, they don't dance and tell

[Chorus]
We live in cities you'll never see onscreen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
And you know we're on each other's team

[Post-Chorus]
I'm kind of over gettin' told to throw my hands up in the air
So there

[Verse 2]
So all the cups got broke
Shards beneath our feet
But it weren't my fault
And everyone's competing for a love they won't receive
Cause what this palace wants is release

[Chorus]
We live in cities you'll never see onscreen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
And you know we're on each other's team

[Bridge]
I'm kind of over gettin' told to throw my hands up in the air
So there
I'm kind of older than I was when I reveled without a care
So there

[Chorus]
We live in cities you'll never see onscreen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
And you know we're on each other's team

[Outro]
We're on each other's team
And you know we're on each other's team
We're on each other's team
We're on each other's team
And you know and you know and you know


Title: Team - Lorde

Lyrics:
[Intro]
Wait 'til you're announced
We've not yet lost all our graces
The hounds will stay in chains
Look upon Your Greatness and she'll send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out

[Verse 1]
Call all the ladies off, they're in their finery
A hundred jewels on throats
A hundred jewels between teeth
Now bring my boys in, their skin in craters like the moon
The moon we love like a brother, while he glows through the room
Dancin' around the lies we tell
Dancin' around big eyes as well, ah
Even the comatose, they don't dance and tell

[Chorus]
We live in cities you'll never see onscreen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Livin' in ruins of the palace within my dreams
And you know we're on each other's team

[Post-Chorus]
I'm kinda over gettin' told to throw my hands up in the air
So there

[Verse 2]
So all the cups got broke
Shards beneath our feet
But it wasn't my fault
And everyone's competin' for a love they won't receive
'Cause what this palace wants is release

[Chorus]
We live in cities you'll never see onscreen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Livin' in ruins of the palace within my dreams
And you know we're on each other's team

[Bridge]
I'm kinda over gettin' told to throw my hands up in the air
So there
I'm kinda older than I was when I reveled without a care
So there

[Chorus]
We live in cities you'll never see onscreen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Livin' in ruins of the palace within my dreams
And you know we're on each other's team

[Outro]
We're on each other's team
And you know we're on each other's team
We're on each other's team
And you know and you know and you know


Title: Tennis Court

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Don't you think that it's
Boring how people talk?
Making smart with their words again
Well, I'm bored
Because
I'm doing this for the thrill of it, killin' it
Never not chasin' a million things I want
And I am
Only as young as the minute is, full of it
Getting pumped up on the little bright things I bought
But I know they'll never own me (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Baby, be the class clown
I'll be the beauty queen in tears
It's a new art form
Showin' people how little we care (Yeah)
We're so happy
Even when we're smilin' out of fear
Let's go down to the tennis court
And talk it up like, "Yeah" (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Pretty soon, I'll be getting
On my first plane
I'll see the veins of my city
Like they do in space
But my head's
Fillin' up fast with the wicked games, up in flames
How can I fuck with the fun again when I'm
Known?
And my
Boys trip me up with their heads again, lovin' them
Everything's cool when we're all in line for the throne
But I know it's not forever (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Baby, be the class clown
I'll be the beauty queen in tears
It's a new art form
Showin' people how little we care (Yeah)
We're so happy
Even when we're smilin' out of fear
Let's go down to the tennis court
And talk it up like, "Yeah" (Yeah)

[Bridge]
It looked all right in the pictures (Yeah)
Getting caught's half of the trip, though, isn't it? (Yeah)
I'll fall apart, with all my heart (Yeah)
And you could watch from your window (Yeah)
Haha
Yeah, you could watch from your window

[Chorus]
Baby, be the class clown
I'll be the beauty queen in tears
It's a new art form
Showin' people how little we care (Yeah)
We're so happy
Even when we're smilin' out of fear
Let's go down to the tennis court
And talk it up like, "Yeah" (Yeah)

[Outro]
And talk it up like, "Yeah" (Yeah)
And talk it up like, "Yeah" (Yeah)
Let's go down to the tennis court
And talk it up like, "Yeah" (Yeah)
And talk it up like, "Yeah" (Yeah)
And talk it up like, "Yeah" (Yeah)
Let's go down to the tennis court
And talk it up like, "Yeah" (Yeah)
