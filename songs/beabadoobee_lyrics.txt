Title: 10:36

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
You don't need me
As much as I need you
As much as I need you
Take it or leave it
'Cause you know that's the truth
'Cause you know that's the truth

[Chorus]
I know you thought it was just us
I didn't think you'd fall in love
You're just a warm body to hold
At night when I'm feeling all alone

[Post-Chorus]
I don't want to, yeah, yeah (I didn't mean that, that thing I said last night, it was)
I don't want to, yeah, yeah (I don't know what happened)
I don't want to, yeah, yeah (I have this thing where I, I can't really be by myself)
I don't want to, yeah, yeah (But look)

[Verse 2]
Called you for the last time
I need to be with you
I need to be with you
Saw you in a dream last night
You looked like a ghost
You looked like a ghost

[Chorus]
I know you thought it was just us
I didn't think you'd fall in love
You're just a warm body to hold
At night when I'm feeling all alone
I know you thought it was just us
I didn't think you'd fall in love
You're just a warm body to hold
At night when I'm feeling all alone
I know you thought it was just us
I didn't think you'd fall in love
You're just a warm body to hold
At night when I'm feeling all alone
(You don't) I know you thought it was just us
(Need me) I didn't think you'd fall in love
(As much as I need you) You're just a warm body to hold
(As much as I need you) At night when I'm feeling all alone

[Post-Chorus]
I don't want to, yeah, yeah
I don't want to, yeah, yeah
I don't want to, yeah, yeah
I don't want to, yeah, yeah


Title: 1999

Lyrics:
Hold me close and say you care
Because I'm in love with your brown hair
The way you touch me is a curse
And I'm not willing to let it all hurt
Watch your mouth and wash with soap
'Cause I just hate the way you spoke
Green eyes make everything feel numb
And I'm not willing to give it all up
And I'm not wasting time again
Closure instead of sex
And I'm not wasting time again
You said I fucked up and ruined your life
But little did you know you ruined
Mine


Title: Angel

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
White angel come
Intoxicates my blood
Just another hit
You'd get used to it
Just another grit

[Chorus]
Your bones are only painted gold
That's why it rots beneath your soul
You're not as brave as you may seem

[Verse 2]
I'm scared of life
It's in my blood
So I blame myself
I blame myself
I blame myself

[Bridge]
White pretty snowflakes
White pretty snowflakes
White pretty snowflakes
Falling on my face

[Chorus]
Your bones are only painted gold
That's why it rots beneath your soul
You're not as brave as you may seem
That's why it hurts me


Title: Angry Song

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Pick up the phone
Please, tell me you're home
The monsters are gone
The wardrobe is closed
Where's my guitar?
They hate when I sing
So, fuck my guitar, yeah
Fuck everything

[Chorus]
Mm-mm, mm-mm
Mm-mm, mm-mm

[Verse 2]
String's on a twist
My ass they can kiss
They're making me sick
Just go suck my dick
"No singing past ten"
"He can't stay in your bed"
So, fuck mom and dad
I'm going real mad

[Chorus]
Mm-mm, mm-mm
Mm-mm, mm-mm
Mm-mm, mm-mm
Mm-mm


Title: A Night To Remember

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Laufey]
Swore I'd seen you before
Watched you walk through the door
Somethin' in your eye
Reminded me of somebody I used to know

[Verse 2: beabadoobee]
You touched my back
I took your hand
Somethin' from your touch felt shockingly familiar
And I swore I'd seen you before

[Pre-Chorus: beabadoobee & Laufey]
Oh, I swore I'd seen you before

[Chorus: beabadoobee & Laufey]
Underneath the sheets
You enchanted me
And whispered sweet nothings in my ear
I shivered beneath you
All wrapped up in embers
It was a night to remember

[Verse 3: Laufey & beabadoobee]
Then I walked away
You asked me to stay
Know you're thinkin' of what could've been
But you've become someone I've seen before

[Pre-Chorus: Laufey]
I swore I'd seen you before

[Chorus: beabadoobee & Laufey]
Underneath the sheets
You enchanted me
And whispered sweet nothings in my ear
I shivered beneath you
All wrapped up in embers
It was a night, enchanting night
To remember

[Outro: Laufey]
Mm


Title: Animal Noises

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I'm still afraid of the dark
But mornings are scarier
'Cause when I'm awake, I spend half of my day
Wondering what to do
I'll miss the 9 a.m train
'Cause I slept through my alarm again
Forgetting to eat is affecting my sleep
But I guess that's just part of the trend

[Chorus]
I miss the mornings I spent
Making animal noises with you
I just need someone to hold
But I guess that I'm getting too old
It's something I keep getting told
I guess that I'm getting too old for this

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Well, I guess that I've made some mistakes
And you know that I've told a few lies
If I call in the morning, I know you'd be boring
And say my behavior's alright
Maybe you like my mistakes
And maybe you get why I lied
Maybe the things that made you wanna live
Were the things that made me wanna die

[Chorus]
I miss the mornings I spent
Making animal noises with you
I just need someone to hold
But I guess that I'm getting too old
It's something I keep getting told
I guess that I'm getting too old for this

[Bridge]
For this, oh
For this
Ah, ah, ah, ah

[Chorus]
I miss the mornings I spent
Making animal noises with you
I just need someone to hold
But I guess that I'm getting too old
It's something I keep getting told
I guess that I'm getting too old for this


Title: Another love song*

Lyrics:
Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse]
Couldn't list all of the reasons
You're everything I want
Falling more at every season
You're everything I want
I'm everything you want

[Chorus]
Now I see
The weather's got me down
But like the sun you'll come around
I had finally figured out
You were just around the corner
As the light falls on my face
Like the scent I almost taste
And it stayed with me for days
And I hope it lasts forever
Oh, such a pretty sight
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Outro]
I'll try and do it right this time
I'll try and do it right this time


Title: Apple Cider

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
We both like apple cider
But your hair be smelling like fruit punch
And I don't even like you that much
Wait, I do, fuck

[Chorus]
Call me at midnight
Let's give this thing a try

[Verse 2]
You said you liked my hair
So go ahead and touch it
You said you liked the jumper I wore
So I always wore it
It's really nice to talk to you
It's really nice to hold your hand
It's really nice to talk to you
It's really nice to hold your hand
And even if we're just friends
We could be more than that
And even if we're just friends
We could be more than that

[Chorus]
So call me at midnight
Let's give this thing a try

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Call me at midnight
Let's give this thing a try
So call me at midnight
Ask you if it's alright
To have a sleepover
To drink some apple cider
Or maybe some fruit punch
And we can talk about how we don't like each other that much


Title: Are You Sure

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
You say you understand
Are you sure, are you sure?
You say you've been to Mars before
Are you sure, are you sure?

[Chorus]
It's funny for you
My state stays the same in outer space
It's funny for you
It's obvious you've never felt this way
It's pretty shit
My brain's alone and no one understands

[Verse 2]
You think you know my brain
Are you sure, are you sure?
You think you know just what to say
Are you sure, are you sure?

[Chorus]
It's funny for you
My state stays the same in outer space
It's funny for you
It's obvious you've never felt this way
It's pretty shit
My brain's alone and no one understands

[Bridge]
So talk to me again
You seem to understand
You claim to say it's fine
But you never really know where I am
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why?

[Chorus]
It's funny for you
My state stays the same in outer space
It's funny for you
It's obvious you've never felt this way
It's pretty shit
My brain's alone and no one understands


Title: Art Class

Lyrics:
You look pretty good today
Is it me or did you shave?
Good, you've been looking at me twice as more
So I can see your face
You sit across from me, in the classroom
But do you even know my name?
If you want to ask me how I am
Don’t hesitate

'Cause you're my cru- cru- crush
And I like you very much
And I’d appreciate
If you'd like me back
But it's okay, 'cause you make my heart
In art class
In art class

Why do you always stick to smiling
And sit still being so quiet?
I've been pretty distracted for some days
And it's ruining my diet
If you don't take the hint already
I'm afraid I’ll start a riot
’Cause you make my whole world go crazy
Yeah your smell just sends me flying

'Cause you’re my cru- cru- crush
And I like you very much
And I'd appreciate
If you'd like me back
But it's okay, ’cause you make my heart
In art class
In art class

All my days
Been trying to find a reason to stay
Say my name
And I'll go ahead and pick a date
I'm okay
If you understand that this is fate

Art class
Art class
Art class
Art class


Title: Atonement

Lyrics:
[Intro]
You want me to be happy
But you can't always be around me
I apologize, I am such a fuck up sometimes
And I realize why

[Chorus]
You're so tired of me
You're so tired of me
You're so tired of me


Title: Back to Mars

Lyrics:
[Verse]
Ask me again, are we friends or are we something more?
Doesn't it hurt to think about how we were just before?
Doesn't matter if sometimes we cannot stick to being friends
Doesn't matter if we break up just to act all fine again
Take me to the south of France where we could just be old friends
We'd go to the beach and you could braid my hair
You could braid my hair


Title: BEABADOOBEE - LOVESONG (CAT.FLP LOVES BOOTLEG)

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: beabadoobee]
I didn't think I'd ever want this yet
When we had first met in fall
Guess it's something you learn to accept
When I've been a mess, it's not your fault

[Pre-Chorus: beabadoobee]
But I keep forgetting it's what we do

[Chorus: beabadoobee]
I-I-I missed the train again
I called your name
As if you'd drive it back
I-I-I swear you're in my head
Throughout the day
I can say that for a fact
Know we had better days
But to keep me sane
I guess that this is just— another love song about you
Just another love song about you
Just another love song about you

[Post-Chorus: beabadoobee]
Doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo

[Verse 2: beabadoobee]
I'm running over sentences at times
I'd bettеr quit dreaming just so I could write
Yet thе words to describe you
Aren't so hard to find
Like a good quote from a book that I've memorized

[Pre-Chorus: beabadoobee]
But I keep forgetting just what to do

[Chorus 2: beabadoobee]
I-I-I missed the train again
I called your name
As if you'd drive it back
I-I-I swear you're in my head
Throughout the day
I can say that for a fact
Know we had better days
But to keep me sane
I-I-I guess that this is just another love song about you
Just another love song about you

[Post-Chorus 2: beabadoobee]
Doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo

Title: Beaches

Lyrics:
Lyrics from Live Preformance

[Verse 1]
Spinning out on words to say or work to do
Finding reasons for my constant change of mood
Said I see it to believe it
But who knows the actual truth?
But I'm sure now
I'm sure

[Chorus]
'Cause days blend to one when I'm on the right beaches
And the walls painted white they tell me all the secrets
Don't wait for the tide just to dip both your feet in
'Cause I'm sure now
I'm sure

[Verse 2]
Find it hard to say that I know I'm alright
Took a while to finally realise that when I see it, I believe it
Giving me a piece of mind
But I'm surе now
I'm sure

[Chorus]
'Cause days blend to onе when I'm on the right beaches
And the walls painted white they tell me all the secrets
Don't wait for the tide just to dip both your feet in
'Cause I'm sure now
I'm sure

[Bridge]
Someday
I'm afraid of falling down
But I only understand the common outcome
Pick it up if I allow it
Can't help it
Can't help

[Chorus]
'Cause days blend to one when I'm on the right beaches
And the walls painted white they tell me all the secrets
Don't wait for the tide just to dip both your feet in
'Cause I'm sure now
I'm sure


Title: Beatopia Cultsong

Lyrics:
[Verse]
Is it me or recently time is moving slowly?
Is it me or recently time is moving slowly?
Is it me or recently time is moving slowly?
Is it me or recently time is moving slowly?
Is it me or recently time is moving slowly?
Is it me or recently time is moving slowly?
Is it me or recently time is moving slowly?
Is it me or recently time is moving slowly?


Title: Better off dead*

Lyrics:
Lyrics from Snippet

[Chorus]
Said, "you'd be better off dead"
They said, "you'd be better off dead"

[Verse]
Do you know my name?
Let me ask again
Cause you don't seem to care
But, ask me how I am

[Chorus]
They said, "you'd be better off dead"
They said, "you'd be better off dead"
They said, "you'd be better off dead"


Title: Between the Bars - ASIA RISING FOREVER

Lyrics:
[Intro]
This is beabadoobee, and this is my cover of "Between the Bars" by Elliott Smith

[Verse 1]
Drink up, baby, stay up all night
With the things you could do, you won't, but you might
The potential you'll be, that you'll never see
The promises you'll only make
Drink up with me now and forget all about
The pressure of days, do what I say
And I'll make you okay and drive them away
The images stuck in your head

[Chorus]
People you've been before
You don't want them around anymore
They push and shove and won't bend to your will
I'll keep them still

[Verse 2]
Drink up, baby, look at the stars
I'll kiss you again, between the bars
Where I'm seeing you there, your hands in the air
Waiting to finally be caught
Drink up one more time and I'll make you mine
I'll keep you apart, deep in my heart
Separate from the rest, where I like you the best
Keep the things you forgot

[Chorus]
People you've been before
You don't want them around anymore
They push and shove and won't bend to your will
I'll keep them still


Title: Bobby

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Bobby was fourteen when she knew
Nothing would last
Wishing her life wouldn't be this bad
'Cause Bobby always thought like this, with the thought of having missed
Every little thing life could bring she dismissed

[Chorus]
'Cause Bobby always saw the bad, blind to the life she had
Who could've blamed her, though?
Bobby was fourteen years old
Bobby was fourteen years old

[Verse 2]
Bobby was fourteen when she knew
Nothing would last
Wishing her mind didn't think so sad
'Cause Bobby always had a stitch on the left side of her wrist
Despite the love she'd get, she dismissed

[Chorus]
'Cause Bobby always saw the bad, blind to the life she had
Who could've blamed her, though?
Bobby was fourteen years old
Bobby was fourteen years old

[Bridge]
And Bobby knew if she'd ended it all, it would be better soon
And if she tried, she would've missed out being happy and be a fool
But deep down Bobby knew she'd find someone like you

[Outro]
Bobby was fifteen when she knew
Some things would last
Wishing her mind never thought that bad
'Cause Bobby still had the stitch on the left side of her wrist
She got all life could give that she'd missed


Title: Break up song

Lyrics:
[Pre-Chorus]
He left me with no answers
10 minutes before my show
So, I got on the plane for 9 hours
Just to cry on the way home
And that I guess it was necessary
And no less than the ordinary
Met this guy, and he's so refreshing
Oh, God, I can get used to this
Oh, God, I can get used to this

[Chorus]
He's got blue eyes, tan skin, always perfect, and he knows it
Cool guy, [?], just the way I like it
Had my eye on him for a long time
Guess I'll stick around for the meantime
Oh, God, I think I'm falling
Oh, God, I think I'm falling

[Verse]
Well, It was broken for a whilе
What's these [?] when thе love is burnt out
There's something we never figured out
So, I put my new shoes on and go for a run
And get the job done
And maybe, fall in love, for the second time

[Chorus]
He's got blue eyes, tan skin, always perfect, and he knows it
Cool guy, [?], just the way I like it
Had my eye on him for a long time
Guess I'll stick around for the meantime
Oh, God, I think I'm falling
Oh, God, I think I'm falling


Title: ​broken cd

Lyrics:
[Chorus]
Don't think I'm over it, it hurt when I was seventeen
Flew by so quickly I could hardly breathe
Don't think I'm over it like how I said I was
Like a broken CD that plays on repeat

[Bridge]
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da

Flew by so quickly I could hardly breathe
Don't think I'm over it like how I said I was
Like a broken CD that plays on repeat


Title: Burden

Lyrics:
[Verse]
Kinda stressed, I think that’s why I’m smokin' again
I think that’s why I’m smokin' again
'Cause if I’m being honest, I need a friend
And I know you know yourself the best
And you’ve been through worst like your therapist said
I know it’s hard to admit you need a helping hand
I know it’s hard to admit you need a helping hand
I guess I’m okay as long as I’ve got my band
I guess I’m okay as long as I’ve got my band

Title: Care

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
It's been a while since I've talked about it
Maybe it's time to cooperate
I need some help to forget about it

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want your sympathy
Stop saying you give a shit
'Cause you don't really

[Chorus]
Care, care, care, yeah
Care, care, care, yeah
Care, care, care, yeah

[Verse 2]
It's been a while since I've thought about it

The fact I still can't forget about it

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want your sympathy
I guess I've had it rough
But you don't really

[Chorus]
Care, care, care, yeah
Care, care, care, yeah

Title: Ceilings

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Love me like a garden filled with flowers
Like the driest desert in the rain
Love me like cigarettes in Paris
Love me like a book that has no name

[Chorus]
Let the birds sing
Let the fish swim
And appreciate the life you live

[Verse 2]
Miss me like the scent of your first room
The thing you've always wanted to go back to
Ceilings were so high when you were five
Miss me like the way your mother misses your height

[Chorus]
Let the birds sing
Let the fish swim
And appreciate the life you live


Title: Charlie Brown

Lyrics:

Has inked you up to slow you down
Has inked you up to slow you down

Throw it away
Throw it away
Throw it away

I call you if I need you
Give my brain a sec
I just need to figure things out
Figure things out

Throw it away
Throw it away

Then what's the point of trying?

Throw it away
Throw it away
Throw it away

And I'll make a cup of coffee with the right amount of sugar how you like it

If you wanna go back home
Oh, babe, at least leave the scent of your cologne
Leave the scent of your cologne

[Chorus]

Please, kiss my neck
Let's go for another round
I hate what this song is about

Title: Coming Home

Lyrics:
[Chorus]
You do the dishes, I'll carry the load
To make up lost time
The trash to the brim and I'm scared of it
But you always know just what to say
And I'm sorry if I'm coming home too late

[Verse]
I'm waking up to the gap on my blinds
Peeking sunlight
I'd do anything just to be with you
To sit and watch you slowly wake
And I'm sorry if I'm coming home too late

[Bridge]
A hotel room only means I'll be with you soon
An American state makes me feel so far away
So,  I promise this time I won't be late
And a bar on the roof's not a good way to leave you too
And a seat on the plane only shows that we're miles away
So, I promise this time I won't be late

[Chorus]
I'll do the dishes, we'll carry thе load
Because we havе time
I emptied the trash like I said I would
And you'd never guess what I have to say
I'm not sorry 'cause this time I won't be late


Title: Cruel Affair

Lyrics:
Lyrics from Poster

[?] they all say [?]
Daze and amaze, how can something sound complicated
Still [?] sweetest smile, with her eyes, perfect style
She doesn't try why
So many are so codependent, wasting time?
And I know somewhere we both care 'cause she's contemplating we're both sat complaining
While we compare
She's a cath but so am I
No point for my [?] problems are so aggravating
Through their eyes and (Know somewhere)
[?] it's exaggerated, we both elaborated
Cruel Affair


Title: CYBERKISS 2 U*

Lyrics:
[Intro]
What's your name?
What's your name?
What's your name?
What's your name?

[Verse 1]
Hit New York for today, tomorrow hit L.A. 
But I can't get peace of mind 'cause I can't go to where you stay
We gotta hit the road so we can make it big
What you doin' for tonight? I'm in Miami, trick
And I can feel the sparks fly when it's just you and me
Even when we FaceTimin', you can feel the chemistry
Swear it all feels brand new, but we got some history
Fell in love (Nigga, stop lyin'), maybe I'm just too geeked for real
I'm just makin' a note of how I feel
Are you feelin' the same? If not, I'll chill
I just need for you to tell me what's the deal
What's the deal?

[Chorus]
I just wanna send you a kiss (Cyber kiss)
Goin' digital with my love (My love)
I just wanna send you a—
I just wanna send you a—
I just wanna send you a kiss
I just wanna send you a kiss (Cyber kiss)
Goin' digital with my love (My love)
I just wanna send you a—
I just wanna send you a—
I just wanna send you a kiss

[Verse 2]
I miss you, your digital footprint's on my brain
Wish I could kiss you, but I'm stuck on this New York subway
My phone is dead, so I guess that text will have to wait
Just hope you know that I'm on the way
Around the world, I'm livin' it up
But knowin' I'm your girl is what I really love
I won't be home today, and I know that really sucks (It sucks)
Promise it's worth the wait, until then, I'll hit you up

[Verse 3]
Spend my time lookin' at pics of you on the internet
Girl, are you into me?
I wanna feel you here
But most the time, you're so far away
Damn, you're so far away
Can you text me back?
When you're sad, I can make it better
You make me feel good, I hope I feel this way forever
You send me kisses through the phone
'Cause you know I like it
'Cause you know I like it
Yeah, 'cause you know I like it

[Chorus]
I just wanna send you a kiss (Cyber kiss)
Goin' digital with my love (My love)
I just wanna send you a—
I just wanna send you a—
I just wanna send you a kiss
I just wanna send you a kiss (Cyber kiss)
Goin' digital with my love (My love)
I just wanna send you a—
I just wanna send you a—
I just wanna send you a kiss

If you wanna dance then
Dance with me
It's pretty fast but
This is what you do at parties, right?

And I know it's hard to tell
But I think I really like you

[Verse 2]
Just take it slow
And move your feet to the beat
'Cause if we dance then
You don’t have to speak

[Chorus]
And I know it's hard to tell
But I think I really like you

I wanna be with you
Because whenever i go to sleep
All i see is you
I don't know why I don't trust myself
Because all i want is to be with you

[Verse: manakeen]
I think we have a bright future for ourselves
Kicking these Retards away like mew
Strike one down because they all hate me
Are they ever going to stop?
Retards over Retards all i see is them
Are they ever going to stop?

[Chorus: manakeen]

Title: Death Bed

Lyrics:
[Chorus]
Don't stay awake for too long, don’t go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed

[Verse 1]
I don’t wanna fall asleep, I don't wanna pass away
I been thinking of our future 'cause I'll never see those days
I don't know why this has happened, but I probably deserve it
Tried to do my best, but you know that I'm not perfect
I been praying for forgiveness, you've been praying for my health
When I leave this earth, hoping you'll find someone else
’Cause yeah, we still young, there’s so much we haven't done
Getting married, start a family, watch my husband with our son
I wish it could be me, but I won’t make it out this bed
I hope I go to heaven so I see you once again
My life was kinda short, but I got so many blessings
Happy you were mine, sucks that it's all ending

[Chorus]
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I’ll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm happy that you here with me, I'm sorry if I tear up
When me and you were younger, you would always make me cheer up
Taking goofy videos and walking through the park
I would jump into your arms every time I heard a bark
Cuddle in your sheets until you sing me sound asleep
And we snuck out of my kitchen at exactly 1:03
Sundays, went to church, on Mondays, watched a movie
Soon you'll be alone, sorry that you have to lose me

[Chorus]
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed

Title: Disappear

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Kiss me on my neck
Tell me all your fears
'Cause the rush of love is gone and
I'm tryna find out why
It disappeared
Why it disappeared

[Verse 2]
I look you in the eyes
Don't feel nothing here
'Cause the feeling of the love
That I used to have
Yeah, that shit's disappeared
Yeah, that shit's disappeared

[Chorus]
Yeah, that shit's disappeared
Yeah, that shit's disappeared
Yeah, that shit's disappeared

[Bridge]
Do you remember
Our love in November?
That shit was so real
But there's patches on my fingers that won't heal
There's patches on my fingers that won't heal
Why'd you have to fucking disappear?
Why'd you have to fucking disappear?

[Chorus]
Why'd you disappear?
Why'd you disappear?
Why'd you disappear?

Please come back
Please come back

Title: Don’t get the deal

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: beabadoobee, Jacob Bugden]
Tell me, how do you feel?
I've realised, you just don’t get the deal
Tell me (I wonder if the time we spend)
How do you feel? (I could have been a fireman)
I've realised (I'm thinking that I don’t get the deal)
You just don't get the deal

[Chorus: beabadoobee & Jacob Bugden]
Take time, I'll wait a little bit
I don't mind, we've done this all before
It feels like we'll stop eventually
For now, I guess we were mеant to be
Take time, I'll wait a littlе bit
I don't mind, we’ve done this all before
It feels like we’ll stop eventually
For now, I guess we were meant to be

[Verse 2: Jacob Bugden, beabadoobee]
Am I caught in a daze?
The look in your eyes
Is never the same
Am I caught in a daze? (I think it's getting harder to see)
The look in your eyes (I know that I’ve been losing sleep)
Is never the same (I don't think it's ever the same)

[Chorus: beabadoobee & Jacob Bugden]
Take time, I'll wait a little bit
I don’t mind, we've done this all before
It feels like we'll stop eventually
For now, I guess we were meant to be
Take time, I'll wait a little bit
I don't mind, we've done this all before
It feels like we'll stop eventually
For now, I guess we were meant to be

[Bridge: beabadoobee & Jacob Bugden]
I needed some time alone
To see that it hurts
You're looking for something
But I'm here to make it worse

[Chorus: beabadoobee & Jacob Bugden]
Take time, I'll wait a little bit
I don't mind, we've done this all before
It feels like we'll stop eventually
For now, I guess we were meant to be
Take time, I'll wait a little bit
I don't mind, we've done this all before
It feels like we'll stop eventually
For now, I guess we were meant to be


Title: Dontstayaway.

Lyrics:
[ Chorus ]

Falling in bed, baby falling for you
Losing my mind when I think about you
Losing my conscious, I don't get the logic
Baby so beautiful, yeah everybody watches
Heart been broke so many times before
Please don’t leave me cause your all I adore
Before you walked up in my life there was tears all on the floor
Baby don’t leave, don't walk out the door

[ verse 1]

Everyday seeing you, loving you more and more
I’ve been thinking about you, thinking about us
A lot of things we still have to, still a lot to discuss
Doing my best to give you things like the moon
I don’t want this to end, but it's probably gonna be soon
Ride with me, fly high with me like balloons
Chillin’ in my room thinking about you, yeah my boo

[ Chorus ]

Falling in bed, baby falling for you
Losing my mind when I think about you
Losing my conscious, I don't get the logic
Baby so beautiful, yeah everybody watches
Heart been broke so many times before
Please don’t leave me cause your all I adore
Before you walked up in my life there was tears all on the floor
Baby don’t leave, don't walk out the door


Title: Dye It Red

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Kiss my ass, you don't know jack
And if you say you understand, you don't
You don't, you don't, you don't
Fuck me only when I'm keen
Not according to your beer
Your beer, your beer, your beer
So let me be what I've wanted to be

[Chorus]
So let me cut my hair and dye it red if I want to
I haven't felt myself so comfortable
I'm not stopping now

[Verse 2]
Touch me as if you mean it
‘Cause I'm getting tired of being all alone
Alone, alone, alone
And if it's not from you, guess I'll find it on my own

[Chorus]
So let me cut my hair and dye it red if I want to
I haven't felt myself so comfortable
I'm not stopping
I think I'd be better off alone
Now that I've had some time to think
I've had to put up with your shit
When you're not even that cute

[Bridge]
And maybe it's time to change my ways
But that doesn't include you

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Let me cut my hair and dye it red if I want to
I haven't felt myself so comfortable
I'm not stopping
I think I'd be better off alone
Now that I've had some time to think
I've had to put up with your shit
When you're not even that cute

[Outro]
That cute, that cute, that cute

Title: Eighteen

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Don't wanna be eighteen with responsibilities
Sometimes I get scared of growing up
Entering a world with broken dreams
Sometimes I get scared and throw it all up

[Chorus]
And June the third is
Coming closer and I'm
Nowhere near closure

[Verse 2]
Don't wanna be eighteen when I can't ride a bike
Still hang onto my sheets during storms
In my bed I'm ten but I can't shut my eyes
I still wish I wore a school uniform

[Chorus]
And June the third is
Coming closer and I'm
Nowhere near closure

[Verse 3]
Don't wanna be eighteen with a messy room
Still wonder what lingers under my bed at night
Kinda wish I stayed at my mother's home
Are we gonna know what it's like to be blind?

[Chorus]
'Cause June the third is
Coming closer and I'm
Nowhere near closure


Title: ​eleanor & park

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: beabadoobee]
The morning bus rides
Your face makes me want to smile
Park, wait for me outside
So you can see what's inside my mind

[Verse 2: girl in red]
I'll bring you comics to make you laugh
On days where you feel kinda sad
I want you to feel adored
Oh my god, I love your voice

[Chorus: girl in red & beabadoobee]
Take me in your arms now, baby
Hold me like you'll never leave me
I know you don't have it easy
You'll get through it if you're with me

[Verse 3: girl in red, beabadoobee]
Eleanor, are you feeling cold?
No hesitation, I'll give you my coat
You're so sweet I'll let you know
You're the type of guy to never let go

[Bridge: beabadoobee, girl in red]
'Cause I don't wanna go back home
I don't wanna want you to be on your own

You'll get through it if you're with me


Title: Emo Song

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Back on old ways, I know your face
I haven't seen you in some days
It hurts my head, my conscience dead
The fact I miss the way it felt

[Chorus]
You're coming back again
Don't want you back again

[Verse 2]
You call me up, and lie again
Like all the men I used to trust
Nobody knows when I was young
I lost myself in cosmic dust

[Chorus]
You're coming back again
Don't want you back again

[Outro]
Just the thought of you doesn't stop
You're not a person or a thing
Just the thought of you on my limbs
It's all your fault
It’s all your fault
It’s all your fault
It’s all your fault


Title: Everest

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
You’re alright, you’re still breathing
Even though you feel dead sometimes
You’ll be fine, you’re still eating
Even though it doesn’t last sometimes

[Chorus]
’Cause even if your eyes are black
Your bones are always gold
’Cause it's climbed up every mountain
That no story’s ever told
’Cause even if your bags are packed
You’ll never leave your home
’Cause you’re scared of all the monsters
That are waiting to unfold

[Verse 2]
Blank noise is an awful sound
And it hurts my ears, I don’t know how
My name’s just a silhouette
Hiding under all the self-doubt

[Chorus]
’Cause even if your eyes are black
Your bones are always gold
’Cause it's climbed up every mountain
That no story’s ever told
’Cause even if your bags are packed
You’ll never leave your home
’Cause you’re scared of all the monsters
That are waiting to unfold

[Outro]
Boy, I’m scared
Boy, I’m scared
Boy, I’m scared
Boy, I’m scared


Title: Ever Seen

Lyrics:
[Chorus]
Spent some time waiting for your face
Don't want to risk just making all the same mistakes
The highest I think I’ve ever been
Said I had the prettiest eyes he'd ever seen

[Verse 1]
Can't help going through it
Swear it’s just the comedown that made me do it
My mind's spent and I show it
Wasting all my time just dwelling in it

[Chorus]
'Cause I spent some time waiting for your face
Don't want to risk just making all the same mistakes
The highest I think I've ever been
Said I had thе prettiest eyеs he'd ever seen

[Verse 2]
Wound up with a purpose
I've been through this too many times to not notice
It's been rough, but I’ve felt worse
I’ll pull myself back up, and you know this

[Chorus]
'Cause I spent some time waiting for your face
Don’t want to risk just making all the same mistakes
The highest I think I've ever been
Said I had the prettiest eyes he'd ever seen
He has the prettiest eyes I've ever seen

[Bridge]
Every piece of me holds parts of you
Wish I could see that it feels much better when I’m with you
And when I get too high and I can't breathe
I can't lie, he has the prettiest eyes I've ever seen

[Outro]
Prettiest eyes I've ever seen
Prettiest eyes I've ever seen
Prettiest eyes I've ever seen


Title: Everything I Want

Lyrics:
Lyrics from Live Performance

[Verse 1]
Couldn't list all of the reasons
You're everything I want
Fallin' more at every season
You're everything I want
I'm everything you want

[Chorus]
Now I see, the weathers got me down
But like the sun you'll come around
I had finally figured out
You were just around the corner
Oh, such a pretty sight
(Ooh, ooh)
I'm tryna do it right this time

[Verse 2]
Out of all the silly feelings
People can say whatever they want
'Cause you're everything I want
And I don't need another thought

[Chorus]
Now I see, thе weathers got me down
But likе the sun you'll come around
I had finally figured out
You were just around the corner
As the light shone on my face
Like the scent I almost taste
And it stayed with me for days
And I hope it lasts forever
You're such a pretty sight
(Ooh, ooh)

[Outro]
I'm tryna do it right this time
I'm tryna do it right this time
I'm tryna do it right this time


Title: ​fairy song

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
You need to drink water, remember to pray
Eat so you're stronger and live for the day
Speak to your brother, check he's ok
Need to get out more, don't smoke all day

[Chorus]
I know you're sad 'cause someone died
But I'm not gonna sit inside and do nothing

[Verse 2]
Guess when I'm older I'll be able to see
That when it gets colder I care less about me
I should sleep like I promised and brush my hair
Always be honest and that would be fair

[Chorus]
I know it’s hard to comprehend
There's so much things we have to mend
I know you're sad 'cause someone died
But I'm not gonna sit inside and do nothing

[Outro]
Guess that's what you meant
We can still be friends
I'm not with you but
(We'll) make it till the end


Title: Falling*

Lyrics:
Lyrics from Live Performance

[Verse 1]
He left me with no answers
Ten minutes before my show
So I got on a plane for nine hours
Just to cry all the way home

[Verse 2]
But I guess it was necessary
And no less than the ordinary
Met this guy and he's so refreshing
Oh god, I can get used to this
Oh god, I can get used to this

[Chorus]
He's got blue eyes, tan skin
Oh, he's perfect and he knows it
Cool guy, and that's just the way I like it
Had my eye on him for a long time
Guess I'll stick around for thе meantime
Oh god, I think I'm falling
Oh god, I think I'm falling

[Verse 3]
Heart got brokе the second time
Whilst it was broken for awhile
Oh, what's the use in trying when the love is burnt out?
That's something we never figured out

[Bridge]
So I put my new shoes on
And go for a run
And get the job done
And maybe fall in love for the second time

[Chorus]
He's got blue eyes, tan skin
Oh, he's perfect and he knows it
Cool guy, and that's just the way I like it
Had my eye on him for the meantime
Guess I'll stick around for a long time
Oh god, I think I'm falling
Oh god, I think I'm falling


Title: ​fall in love with a girl

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Cavetown]
You can't force him to love you
He can’t expect you to be alright
With all the bullshit he gives you
You wake up drenched in mosquito bites

[Pre-Chorus: Cavetown]
But if you fall in love with a girl
She'll make you feel like the world is on your shoulder
When you're holding her hand
The first time that you kiss, you smell lilacs on her lips
And when you need a little space
You know that she’ll understand

[Chorus: Cavetown]
That boy, let him go
Lights are on, but no one's home
Enough's enough, find your pearl
And fall in love with a girl

[Verse 2: Beabadoobee]
I've never wanted to see him
I just wantеd to be someone
That you see on your cеiling
He never saw me in anyone
I wanna say how I'm feeling
We haven't talked in like eighteen months
I told my boyfriend I'm leaving
I thought that maybe we could hook up

[Pre-Chorus: Cavetown & Beabadoobee]
I heard you fell in love with a girl
She makes you feel like the world is on your shoulder
When you're over your head
She’ll love you carefully, drawing letters on the beach
And you finally found a place where you don’t have to pretend

[Chorus: Cavetown]
That boy, let him go
Lights are on, but no one's home
Enough’s enough, find your pearl
And fall in love with a girl
That boy, let him go
Lights are on, but no one's home
Enough's enough, find your pearl
And fall in love with a girl


Title: Fear Of Flying

Lyrics:
[Intro]
You're listening to Mac Wetha

[Verse 1: Mac Wetha]
Planes falling out of the sky
People laughing and crying
You can do what you like
Dive a little deeper, only this time
Need to see what I find
Is there anything inside?
Gotta make it work this time
Gotta make it worth my time
Gotta make all my words rhyme
Ah, ah

[Chorus: Mac Wetha & beabadoobee]
What if I reach and find nothing?
Palms open just to feel something

[Post-Chorus: beabadoobee]
I'm not gonna make a mistake
I'm not gonna make a mistake
I'm just gonna make it, gonna make it better

[Verse 2: Aminé]
Eyes on me by the millions (Millions)
Sober but I'm trippin' (Trippin')
Can't say l've been comfy in my skin
I feel chameleon (True)
I got some permanent ways (Ways)
Ignorin' what my therapist say (Say)
Afraid to dig deeper 'cause it's so much cheaper
And I hate to see my soul on display
That man in the mirror (Whoa)
Gotta face that man in the mirror (Whoa)
I pray to God I see shit clearer (Whoa)
Until that day it's trial and error (True)
Feelin' content, feel like foreign lands
Grabbin' my fate with some scissor hands
My plug is my middle man
From heaven to hell, but he know I don't give a damn (True)

[Chorus: Mac Wetha & beabadoobee]
What if I reach and find nothing?
Palms open just to feel something

[Post-Chorus: beabadoobee, Aminé]
I'm not gonna make a mistake
I'm not gonna make a mistake
I'm just gonna make it, gonna make it better
I'm not gonna make a mistake (Feelin' content, feel like foreign lands)
I'm not gonna make a mistake (Grabbin' my fate with some scissor hands)
I'm just gonna make it (My plug is my middle man), gonna make it better (But he know I don't give a damn)


Title: First Date

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Meet me by the corner shop
The one that sells the flower pots
To tell me that you bought it with your cash
And not your mother's coupons

[Verse 2]
Build a rocket ship out of soft clay
And take me right up into space
And I can see how our day went
We'll see if we're just friends

[Chorus]
'Cause I know you know
It's still pretty awkward
Grow some balls and just say
Where'd you wanna go, where'd you
Where'd you wanna go on our first date?


Title: First Day Of My Life

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
This is the first day of my life
I swear I was born right in the doorway
I went out in the rain; suddenly, everything changed
They're spreading blankets on the beach
Yours is the first face that I saw
I think I was blind before I met you
Now I don’t know where I am
I don’t know where I’ve been
But I know where I want to go

[Chorus]
And so, I thought I’d let you know
That these things take forever
I especially am slow
But I realize that I need you
And I wondered if I could come home

[Verse 2]
Remember the time you drove all night
Just to meet me in the morning?
And I thought it was strange, you said everything changed
You felt as if you'd just woke up
And you said “This is the first day of my life
I’m glad I didn’t die before I met you
But now, I don’t care; I could go anywhere with you
And I’d probably be happy”

[Chorus]
So if you wanna be with me
With these things, there’s no telling
We just have to wait and see
But I’d rather be working for a paycheck
Than waiting to win the lottery
Aha mmm
Besides, maybe this time is different?
I mean, I really think you like me


Title: Fix

Lyrics:
My heart hurts like shit
Haven't got used to this
My hand fits right into yours
When I don't have my fix I'm torn
When my hands not in yours I'm bored
My heart feels like shit


Title: Further Away

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Say what you want
It's hard 'cause it sucks
I'll just pretend to give a fuck
Maybe then you'll try to stop

[Chorus]
'Cause was it so hard
To keep your mouth shut?
You say the moon's miles away
But your brain's further away

[Verse 2]
Who's laughing now?
The shit that you used to say is out your mouth
Guess you feel better now

[Chorus]
'Cause was it so hard
To keep your mouth shut?
You say the moon's miles away
But your brain's further away

[Outro]
Further away
Further away
Further away


Title: Get Along

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Tell me the things you let me know
No need to rush, we'll take it slowly
Guess our world's colliding (Yeah)
The difference in us is hard to prove
Guess I just have to get to know you
But (Yeah) I'll take my time trying

[Pre-Chorus]
Memories through photographs
That makes us laugh

[Chorus]
I think we do get along just right
So why won't we stay for a while?
I think we do get along just right
So why won't we stay for a while?

[Post-Chorus]
It's you, it's you
It's you (It's you), it's you

[Verse 2]
Spending all of our time figuring what to do
Not too far there's a place just for us two
It's an endless world that's outside, so I'm sticking with you (Just you)
Guess it's fine, in our minds there's enough to do (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Memories through photographs
That makes us laugh

[Chorus]
I think we do get along just right
So why won't we stay for a while? (Woah)
I think we do get along just right
So why won't we stay for a while?

[Bridge]
In a place not far from home
Somewhere we both go
In our way, we can't relay
In the end, we're just the same (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I think we do get along just right (I do)
So why won't we stay for a while? (Woah)
I think we do get along just right (That's right)
So why won't we stay for a while? (Yeah)
I think we do get along just right
So why won't we stay for a while? (For a while)
I think (Yeah) we do get along just right (Woah)
So why won't we stay for a while? (Woah)

[Post-Chorus]
It's you, it's you
It's you, it's you
It's you, it's you
It's you, it's you, mhm


Title: Girl Song

Lyrics:
Lyrics from Snippet & Poster

In a way, I'm figuring it out at my own pace
Just a girl who overthinks about proportions or her waist
The creases on her face
Day like no other, and just another bad day
All I want to do is find the words to make it up to you
Making all the same mistakes
I guess there's still a lot to prove and there's something I can't say in an ordinary way
Day like no other, and just another bad day
Waking up to [?]
[?] my own face
Just another stanger in the mirror, thinking
Oh what a shame, didn't think she'd look this way
Don't look no different than I looked yesterday
All I want to do is find the words to make it up to you
Making all the samе mistakes
I guess therе's still a lot to prove and there's something I can't say in an ordinary way
Day like no other, and just another bad day
Brain's no good at fighting
My hands are tired and I'm out loose
And I'm no good at lying; I'm better at denying
The consequences that stands
Damn, I need a helping hand
Day like no other, and just another bad day


Title: GLITCH IN YOUR HEART

Lyrics:
[Verse]
You ought to know that
I think we're one and the same-ame-ame-ame
I don't think we could help it
No, I don't think we could help it
We don't talk much
Guess 'cause nothing has chan-an-an-an—
I'm not sure I like it
And I'm so tired of fighting

[Chorus]
If I told you, you know how to
Go and break my heart in two-o?
'Cause I would anyway-ay-ay
We'd end going like always-ays-ays
You know me, you better show me
That you could say it to my fa-ace
'Cause you know we're the same-ame-ame
There's worse things I can take-ake

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
If I told you, you know how to
Go and break my hеart in two-o?
'Cause I would anyway-ay-ay
We'd end going likе always-ays-ays
You know me, you better show me
That you could say it to my fa-ace
'Cause you know we're the same-ame-ame
There's worse things I can take-ake


Title: Glue Song

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I've never known someone like you
Tangled in love, stuck by you
From the glue
Don't forget to kiss me
Or else you'll have to miss me
I guess I'm stuck forever by the glue
Oh, and you

[Verse 2]
Finding the right words
To use for this song
I have you in mind
So it won't take so long
Never thought I'd find you
But you're here
And so I love you

[Chorus]
I'm not wrong
When I say I've been stuck
By the glue onto you
I've been stuck by glue
Right onto you
I've been stuck by glue

[Outro]
I've never known
I've never known someone like you
I've never known
I've never known someone like you


Title: He Gets Me So High

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: beabadoobee]
He pretends he is my closest friend
It's a lie, my cries
Won't uncloak his disguise
He's a kick on my side
And I wish that I knew why
He gets me so high

[Chorus: beabadoobee]
He gets me so high
He gets me so high
I could stay in bed
But I can't stay in my head
He gets me so high

[Verse 2: beabadoobee & Jacob Bugden]
He gets fed and lives under my bed
It's been said that it's all just in my head
(Are you feeling alive?)
I'll come back when I need you
(Just pretend that it's fine)
I need to know that I want you
(You hate the fact that I'm right)
Whеn I know that I
I always end up coming back to you

[Chorus: beabadoobee]
He gets mе so high
He gets me so high
I could stay in bed
But I can't stay in my head
He gets me so high

[Outro: beabadoobee]
So high (So high)
So high
So high (So high)
So high (So high)
So high (So high)
So high
He gets me so high


Title: Highschool Pub

Lyrics:
None


Title: Home Alone

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I'm awake
Can you see me now?
And if you stay
We can lounge about
And I'm getting tired
But you make me feel awake
And at the end of the night
Maybe we can stay up late

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm just all alone
Sitting at home
And you should stay
If you don't mind
I'll be okay
If you stay
'Cause you should stay
If you don't mind

[Verse 2]
On my own
I miss you here
Sun is gone
And the clouds are near
And I'm getting tired of being
By myself
'Cause at the end of the night
Maybe you can help yourself

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm just all alone
Sitting at home
And you should stay
If you don't mind
I'll be okay
If you stay
'Cause you should stay
If you don't mind

[Outro]
I'm just all alone
Sitting at home
And you should stay
If you don't mind
I'll be okay
If you stay
'Cause you should stay
If you don't mind


Title: Horen Sarrison

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
You are the smell of pavement after the rain
You are the last empty seat on a train
And I'm convinced you're from outer space

[Chorus]
And I want you to know that I'm in love
But I don't want you to feel comfortable

[Verse 2]
You are the song that I need for my mental state
You are the bus that stayed when I thought I was late
So I'm convinced you're from outer space

[Chorus]
And I want you to know that I'm in love
But I don't want you to feel comfortable
Eyes so green, I don't know what that means
But you make me feel like all this is real
But I don't want you to feel comfortable
And I want you to know that I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love

[Bridge]
And I want to keep you quiet
And I know you feel the same
And I'm sorry I'm gone so often
But I know you'd do the same
The same
The same

[Chorus]
And I want you to know that I'm in love
But I don't want you to feel comfortable
Eyes so green, I don't know what that means
But you make me feel like all this is real
But I don't want you to feel comfortable
And I want you to know that I'm in love


Title: How Was Your Day?

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
How was your day?
Was it okay?
'Cause we haven't talked in a while
Forgotten how you used to smile
What do you look like?
Remember when we used to fight?

[Pre-Chorus]
And I miss getting angry at you
'Cause at least I felt something new

[Chorus]
'Cause I miss all the fuck ups we've had
'Cause even then, you're the best I've had

[Verse 2]
Call me up late
Say it's okay
'Cause I'll be away for a while
I can't remember your smile
You used to kiss me
Guess it's not hard to believe

[Pre-Chorus]
That I miss getting angry at you
'Cause at least I felt something new

[Chorus]
'Cause I miss all the fuck ups we've had
'Cause even then you're the best I've had
'Cause even when I'm miles away I know
You'll still want me as usual
But the thing that I know is that I wanna be with you

[Verse 3]
How was your day?
Was it okay?
'Cause we haven't asked in a while
Remember when we used to smile

[Pre-Chorus]
You used to miss me
Guess it's not hard to believe
That things have to change like the weather and the days

[Chorus]
But the thing that I know is that I wanna be with you


Title: Hurry Home

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: beabadoobee]
You've been runnin' 'round my mind for a couple weeks
Guess that's why it's hard for me to fall asleep
Your lips, your lips, your lips, yeah
You're in, you're in my head, yeah
Tired of getting tangled under the sheets
You call me up at night and I'm too scared to speak
Your lips, your lips, your lips, yeah
You're in, you're in my head, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: beabadoobee]
We don't talk too much
I need constant touch
Maybe something's wrong
We can fix it if you want to
Hidin' me too much
Think we're out of touch
Maybe something's wrong
We can fix it if you want to

[Chorus: No Rome]
I wanna see you but it's gonna hurt
We got some problems but we'll make it work
Stop for a second when you lost your temper
I'm sorry 'bout that time I met your mother
My father told me I should watch it burn
You saw me but I had to make a turn
I wanna see you when you go to work but
We got some problems and it's gonna hurt

[Verse 2: Jay Som]
Wish that we could make this all a distant memory
Caught up in each other and all our secret daydreams
Picturing the moment I see your face again
Find it hard to know that I can't replace you yet

[Pre-Chorus: Jay Som]
We gotta make this work
We gotta make it work
We gotta make it work
We can fix it if you want to

[Chorus: No Rome]
I wanna see you but it's gonna hurt (Gonna hurt)
We got some problems but we'll make it work (Make it work)
Stop for a second when you lost your temper
I'm sorry 'bout that time I met your mother
My father told me I should watch it burn (Watch it burn)
You saw me but I had to make a turn (Make a turn)
I wanna see you when you go to work but
We got some problems and it's gonna hurt
I wanna see you but it's gonna hurt (Gonna hurt)
We got some problems but we'll make it work (Make it work)
Stop for a second when you lost your temper
I'm sorry 'bout that time I met your mother
My father told me I should watch it burn (Watch it burn)
You saw me but I had to make a turn (Make a turn)
I wanna see you when you go to work but
We got some problems and it's gonna hurt

[Outro: No Rome]
I want to see you but it's gonna hurt (Gonna hurt)
We got some problems but we'll make it work (Make it work)
Stop for a second when you lost your temper
I'm sorry 'bout that time I met your mother
My father told me I should watch it burn (Watch it burn)
You saw me but I had to make a turn (Make a turn)
I want to see you when you go to work but
We got some problems and it's gonna hurt


Title: If You Want To

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
If you wanna take me
Go ahead and try my head
Experience is nothing compared to
The sleep paralysis in my bed
If you wanna love me
Try to get inside my brain
Experience is nothing compared to
The nights I'm always up so late

[Pre-Chorus]
Bed bugs in my mind
Keep them all alive
Insomnia creeps at night
Sleep paralysis till I die
Die

[Chorus]
'Cause if you want, you could stay with me in my bed
If you want to, only if you want to
If you want, you could go ahead and fix my head
If you want to, only if you want to

[Post-Chorus]
If you wanted to
If you try to

[Verse 2]
Wishing I still had my dreams
Late night started, take up space
'Cause every time I try to remember
Lack of sleep takes half my brain

[Pre-Chorus]
Bed bugs in my mind
Keep them all alive
Insomnia creeps at night
Sleep paralysis till I die
Die

[Chorus]
'Cause if you want, you could stay with me in my bed
If you want to, only if you want to
If you want, you could go ahead and fix my head
If you want to, only if you want to
Use some pesticides and throw it in my brain
If you want to, only if you want to
Bed bugs keep me up at night and I'm going insane
If they try to, only if they try to

[Post-Chorus]
If you wanted to
If you try to

[Chorus]
'Cause if you want, you could stay with me in my bed
If you want to, only if you want to
If you want, you could go ahead and fix my head
If you want to, only if you want to
Use some pesticides and throw it in my brain
If you want to, only if you want to
Bed bugs keep me up at night and I'm going insane
If they try to, only if they try to


Title: ​iScream

Lyrics:
[Chorus]
I'm not who I like
I'll fight you till I'm right
I'm right you're wrong
In my mind, I scream this song

[Verse 1]
Korbin my best friend
Taught me everything I know in my head
And he's brain dead in the tool shed
Didn't hear a single word you said
I must apologize
Say it one more time Mr. Magpie
Goodbye cool guy
Laugh again you're gonna get a bruised eye
What's your problem with me?
Something's gone wrong
What the hell is happening?

[Chorus]
I bleed
I scream
Ice creams under my jeans
What the world doesn't get is I'm me
In my Rocky beep beep
I'm not who I likе
I'll fight you till I'm right
I'm right you're wrong
In my mind, I scream this song

[Verse 2]
This could be forеver
Is that too much to ask?
We'll try and make it last one day more
We could be together hang out in the day
Then you'll eat my brain so whatever

[Bridge]
In my dreams
This ice cream is for everyone
And I want you to be the one
In my dreams
We'll ride around the block sometime
Then I'll take you back to mine

[Chorus]
I bleed
I scream
Ice creams under my jeans
What the world doesn't get is I'm me
In my Rocky beep beep

I'm not who I like
I'll fight you till I'm right
I'm right you're wrong
In my mind, I scream this song
In my Rocky beep beep

[Verse 3]
I vindicated
You're saturated
Will you stop faking it?
Just a wannabe beep beep
I dream bitstream
I can't explain it
And I just shaved my head
Goodbye, honeybee beep beep

[Chorus]
I bleed
I scream
Ice creams under my jeans
What the world doesn't get is I'm me
In my Rocky beep beep

I'm not who I like
I'll fight you till I'm right
I'm right you're wrong
In my mind, I scream this song

[Outro]
Whats your problem with me?
I'm right you're wrong
In my mind I scream this song


Title: ​i think i love the blood

Lyrics:
[Intro]
La-la-la, la-la-la

[Verse]
I think I love the blood (Do-do-do)
What's the use if I end up numb? (Do-do-do)
Walk around like a clueless drunk (Clueless drunk)
I'll go away, say I went for a run (Run away)
Forever, and ever, and ever, and ever
Forever, and ever, and ever, and ever
And I know, and you know, and you know
Forever, and ever, and ever, and ever
And I know, and you know, and you know

[Outro: beabadoobee]
Uhm, I want them to feel less alone with their feelings
Uhm, to understand that things that happen in your life happen for a reason
And make you become the person that you are today


Title: It’s Only A Paper Moon

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Say it's only a paper moon
Sailing over a cardboard sea
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me
Yes, it's only a canvas sky
Hanging over a muslin tree
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

[Chorus]
Without your love
It's a honky tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played in a penny arcade

[Verse 2]
It's a Barnum and Bailey world
Just as phony as it can be
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

[Bridge]
Say it's only a paper moon (Say it's only you)
Sailing over a cardboard sea (Wouldn't you believe?)
But it wouldn't be make-believe (If you believed in)
If you believed in me (Me)
Yes, it's only a canvas sky (Sailing over a sea)
Hanging over a muslin tree (Wouldn't you just believe?)
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

[Outro]
Without your love
It's a honky tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played in a penny arcade


Title: I Wish I Was Stephen Malkmus

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Think I'm starting to change
With the weeks and the days
Got this new blue-haired phase

[Pre-Chorus]
I think I kinda like it, think I kinda like it
Yeah

[Chorus]
Think I kinda like it
’Cause I get tired of the same shit
Got new hair, a new phase
I'm from outer space
And I'm pretty sure I’ll get used to it

[Verse 2]
Guess I'm tryna get by
'Cause like the weather, I change with time

[Pre-Chorus]
And I sit at home, cry to Pavement
I wish I was Stephen Malkmus
I wanted change, no one forced it
My hair is blue, it's pretty obvious
That I kinda like it, think I kinda like it
Yeah

[Chorus]
Think I kinda like it
'Cause I get tired of the same shit
Got new hair, a new phase
I'm from outer space
And I'm pretty sure I'll get used to it

[Bridge]
So now I’ve changed, I’ve been feeling comfy
Now I've changed, I’ve been feeling lonely
'Cause your photos suck, your brand is shit
You're up your butt
You never really ask me how I am
Ask me how I am

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I sit at home, cry to Pavement
I wish I was Stephen Malkmus
I wanted change, no one forced it
My hair is blue, it’s pretty obvious
That I kinda like it, think I kinda like it
Nice

[Chorus]
Think I kinda like it
'Cause I get tired of the same shit
Got new hair, a new phase
I'm from outer space
And I'm pretty sure I'll get used to it

[Outro]
Fuck


Title: Last Day On Earth

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
You made it
It's your last day on Earth
You killed someone last night
And burned down a church
Oh, you made it
For what it's worth
Well, and if it all goes wrong
And it looks like we'll soon be gone
Then we should all just get along
And sing a song I wrote
And it goes like this, it goes

[Chorus]
Shoop-doop-doo, shoop-doo, badoobadoo
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoo, oh yeah
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo

Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoo, oh yeah
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
You made it along
You got a problem with Peter, you got a problem with John
You can't go on
All this follow me shit
I want to get fucked up at home
Be naked alone
And turn up my phone
Because this song I wrote is just so fucking sick, it goes..
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo
Wait, I got something to say
(What's that? Oh shit)
I forgot, wait a minute
The world's about to end so I'm gonna have to finish
I guess if it were nicer, we'd be better off innit?
I haven't got a plan, so I'm think I'm gonna wing it
Naked, alone with this song I wrote and it goes like this
It goes

[Chorus]
Shoop-doop-doo, shoop-doo, badoobadoo
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoo, oh yeah
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Title: Lovesong

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I didn't think I'd ever want this yet
When we had first met in fall
Guess it's something you learn to accept
When I've been a mess, it's not your fault

[Pre-Chorus]
But I keep forgetting it's what we do

[Chorus]
I missed the train again
I called your name
As if you'd drive it back
I swear you're in my head
Throughout the day
I can say that for a fact
Know we had better days
But to keep me sane
I guess that this is just another love song about you
Just another love song about you

[Post-Chorus]
Doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo

[Verse 2]
I'm running over sentences at times
I'd better quit dreaming just so I could write
Yet the words to describe you
Aren't so hard to find
Like a good quote from a book that I've memorized

[Pre-Chorus]
But I keep forgetting just what to do

[Chorus]
I missed the train again
I called your name
As if you'd drive it back
I swear you're in my head
Throughout the day
I can say that for a fact
Know we had better days
But to keep me sane
I guess that this is just another love song about you
Just another love song about you

[Post-Chorus]
Doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo


Title: Make it up to you

Lyrics:
[Verse]
Just waiting for a better time
Find the words im feelin on the low
A black hole rose from a perfect home
Can i take this love to be my own?
My heart is loose i'm hard to lose
Wanna take it out to use
Another day, I feel the same
Wanna make it up to you
Wanna make it up to you


Title: Maniac

Lyrics:
None


Title: Mars

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I'll take a rocket ship to Mars
We can talk through the dark
Tell you things in my head
Then maybe I can go to bed

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you and I
Both recognize
It's colder outside
So I think you'd rather just stay the night

[Chorus]
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do

[Verse 2]
Scared of love and scared of sleep
Spent too long just counting sheep
You don't understand the feelings in my brain, so
Why would you expect to see?
Stay up talking 'til it's late
Tell you things that's in my brain
'Cause even though you never really understand, we
Always seem to feel the same

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you and I
Both recognize
It's colder outside
So I think you'd rather just stay the night

[Chorus]
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do

[Bridge]
And the air seems colder than other nights, and
You're not willing to put up a fight, and
We both know we'd rather stay inside, so
I just think you should stay the night

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do


Title: Milk

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Straight lines, they unwind you
She does a little thing with her eyes that says, "We're off soon"
She says the bleeding's incidental 'cause she's so cool
She said, "I'm no fun if you've only got a bottle of wine"

[Chorus]
And now she's doing it all the time
Yeah, she's doing it all the time

[Verse 2]
Slow down, yeah I want you
She does a little bit on the sly that shows what she's up to
She started talking about missing him, she was glistening
It won't mend your heart it's only couple of lines

[Chorus]
And now she's doing it all the time
Yeah, she's doing it all the time
Yeah, she's doing it all the time
Yeah, she's doing it all the time
Yeah, she's doing it all the time

Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed

Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed


Title: No punctuation song

Lyrics:
Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna go nowhere
'Cause you're home to me
You are everywhere
And all I breathe is you
And I only care about us
Two peas in a pod, that's what we are
It's me and you

[Chorus]
You are everything
You are everything

[Verse 2]
I don't care what they have to say
They have no clues to say
It's miscommunicated by the fools who just
Like to hide away behind a screen
With lies that they give away

[Chorus]
It makes me scream
It makеs me scream

[Verse 3]
I'm not gonna make thе same mistakes I used to make
I know it's the least that you deserve
And through the worst, we'll make amends
No need to try pretend again

[Pre-Chorus]
This time feels different
This time feels different
This time feels different

[Chorus]
'Cause you are everything
'Cause you are everything

Title: Pictures of Us

Lyrics:
[Verse]
Pictures of us
Buildings and rust

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know what it means to get better
Last night's emergency
Her and me

[Chorus]
She reminded me that God starts with a capital
But I don't think I could do it all
No, I don't think I could do it
She reminded me that God starts with a capital
But I don't think I could do it all
No, I don't think I could do it

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't know what it means to get better
Last night's emergency
Her and me

[Chorus]
She reminded me that God starts with a capital
But I don't think I could do it all
No, I don't think I could do it
She reminded me that God starts with a capital
But I don't think I could do it all

She reminded me that God starts with a capital
But I don't think I could do it
No, I don't think I could do it


Title: Post

Lyrics:
Lyrics from Poster

Said he's getting tired from running as fast as he can
Daddy always said he was [?] life worth living
But as hard as it gets guess sometimes you learn to forget
And all I wanted the most was to see your name on the post
He said— He said—  something ’bout her is hard to regret
Falling [?] everytime she looked at him
He's breaking a sweat: I think I'm lonely
And all he wanted the most was to see her name on the post
She said—  She said—
[?] not waiting any longer for you
Realising [?] that one took too long for you to show it
[?]
He said—
He said—
He said—
He said—


Title: Quit

Lyrics:
Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse]
We aren't the same no more
We called it quits, but, what for?
But, I can't help but hear you say
"I miss you babe, how was your day?"


Title: Real Man

Lyrics:
Lyrics from Poster & TikTok live

Why don't you [?] another [?]
I'm not going for no other
I told my mother what you did, like a kid
And I already told you that I wanted to dance
Could you see me standing out here
With my outstretched hands
I guess no one ever taught you how to be a real man, hm
Walking as the morning beckons
You said you'd be a second
Locked the back door, should've mentioned, yeah
Should've expected
I'm out here blue, what to do?
And I already told you I'm not part of the band
Please forgive mе just for thinking it's a fleetin' romance
I guess no one еver taught you how to be a real man, hm
I hope you last


Title: Ripples

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Please don't make me hide, I've been putting up a fight
What's the use of it now? When I get pulled down anyways
I've been hiding my expression, you can't blame the reflections
And the ripples on the ground, I might as well have drowned

[Chorus]
So I'm keeping busy, work twice as hard as you
Want you to believe me that I can pick and choose
Said you'd let me drive your car as long as I'm with you
Then you'd wait till we get far to tell me that you'll be gone soon

[Verse 2]
Feels too late right now, I've been holding back
'Causе I'm afraid that I'm too loud six feet underground
I feel alone again, stuck between my friеnds
I guess I'll figure my way through them, not sure how I do it
But I'm sure now, the people would listen as the water glistens
And I see my reflection, so much clearer

[Chorus]
So I'm keeping busy, work twice as hard as you
Want you to believe me that I can pick and choose
Said you'd let me drive your car as long as I'm with you
Then you'd wait till we get far to tell me that you'll be gone soon


Title: Sailor Moon

Lyrics:
[Chorus: King NoFace & Beabadoobie]
Don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed

[Verse 1: King NoFace]
I don't know what to do
In times like this but look to you
They don't know what I been through
I pray right to the moon
One day, I'll find you
One day you'll like me back
One day, I'll be happy with myself and that's a fact
Or at least I hope
I don't really know
It keeps me up at night
All these questions in my mind
I know, I won't get no answers
And I can't change that
I gotta keep fighting this cancer
Find out where the pain at
Rest in peace to my grandpa
Lookin' right at death
And we havin' a standoff
He showed me don't be scared
No matter what comes
He showed me to keep working
For all those that I love
I feel so many things it's hard to tell how I feel
I like to think that no god can ever make me kneel
I like to cry at night, to remind myself I'm real
I got these demons I can no longer conceal

[Chorus: King NoFace & Beabadoobie]
Don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed

[Verse 2: King NoFace]
No matter what happens
Promise me, you'll keep going on through the madness
In honesty, I might break down with you
Those cold, cold nights when you don't know what else to do
Uh, I love my mama
I love you dad
Y'all gave me shit that you ain't had
And I am grateful for that
I love my older brother and my younger
We got another on the way
And we gon' show him how to stunt bruh
I gotta learn a lot of things on my own
I hope it don't ruin your world
And to be honest I hesitate to be honest
I'm still scared to tell you I like boys and girls
As I slowly learn to love myself
I'll be more happy, and never leave y'all on the shelf
As I slowly learn to love myself
I'll be more happy, and never leave y'all on the shelf

[Outro: King NoFace]
One day
One day
One day, we can be together
We don't bleed when we're with each other
Sailor moon, you're all that I see
One day
One day
One day, we can meet each other
We rest easy when we're under covers
Sailor moon, won't turn it's back on me


Title: Sea Of Love

Lyrics:
Come with me, my love
To the sea, the sea of love
I want to tell you
How much I love you

Do you remember when we met
That's the day I knew you were my pet
I want to tell you
How much I love you

Come with me
To the sea
Of love

Do you remember when we met
That's the day I knew you were my pet
I want to tell you
How much I love you

Come with me
To the sea
Of love

Do you remember when we met
That's the day I knew you were my pet
I want to tell you
How much I love you


Title: See you Soon

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I wanted to be everything you see
But I went the wrong direction, you needed some affection

[Chorus]
And I'm not sure why but I will see you soon
(I guess I have to take it, I'm deteriorating)
Feelin' blue

[Verse 2]
It's a walk in the park, you said, "It's not that hard"
I'm feelin' kinda dizzy, I don't want this to leave me

[Chorus]
And I told you, "I'll see you soon"
(I guess I have to take it, I'm deteriorating)
Feelin' blue
(I'd rather have a meaning, and it looks appealing)
I want you

[Bridge]
Had some time away, didn't wanna go insane from this
I wanted you to know I need time to grow and to exist
I think I needed space, let you know I'm safe
I swear it's just a littlе thing

[Chorus]
See you soon
(I guess I have to take it, I'm dеteriorating)
Feelin' blue
(I'd rather have a meaning, and it looks appealing)
I want you


Title: She Plays Bass

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Hey, won't you call me back?
'Cause I've been waiting for a text back
It hurts my brain
This chick who plays bass

[Chorus]
She plays bass, she plays bass
Nothing matters 'cause we're both in space
Pretty sure we could never date
She plays bass, she plays bass

[Verse 2]
Guess we're both stuck in the same boat
The world doesn't seem to get us, though
You're just stuck in space
Just playing your bass

[Chorus]
She plays bass, she plays bass
Nothing matters 'cause we're both in space
Pretty sure we could never date
She plays bass, she plays bass

[Bridge]
She plays bass, she plays bass
Nothing matters 'cause we're both in space
How I wish we could just date
So you could teach me how to be more like you
Evif, ruof, eerht, owt, eno

[Outro]
Wish I was more like you
Wish I was more like you
Wish I was more like you


Title: Silver Into Rain

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Luna Li]
Someday I’ll be caught up in the wind
Maybe I’ll spill it out my skin
And the earth will take me down
One day I’ll no longer have my bed
And I’ll forget the things you said
On a rainy week in June

[Chorus: Luna Li]
Blowing away, I’m sipping on rosé
Turning gold into grey and the silver into rain
Blow me away, I’m too young for my age
Too shy for the stage, too careful to be brave

[Bridge: Beabadoobee]
Oh, getting hard to see things straight
It’s not too late
Oh, getting hard to see things straight
It’s not too late

[Chorus: Luna Li, Luna Li & Beabadoobee]
Blowing away, I’m sipping on rosé
Turning gold into grey and the silver into rain
Blow me away, I’m sipping on rosé
Gold into grey and the silver into rain
I’m blowing away, I’m sipping on rosé
Gold into grey and the silver into rain
Blowing away I’m sipping on rosé
Turning gold into grey and the silver
I’m too young for my age


Title: Sleepless

Lyrics:
[Intro]
Okay now
We gonna slow it down
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1: Jack Steadman & Jay Som]
I swear it's re-occuring
I guess I can't keep with it
I need sleep to keep me going
But I just can't seem to get it
It's like when you're never with me
The days just feel the same
And it's getting harder to see
All the things I need to change
Woo-oh, woo-oh-oh

[Verse 2: Jay Som]
The world is underwhelming
My center's out of range
Hold it somewhere in my memory
Hope that you would do the same
I wake up in the moment
But the feeling doesn't change
And I don't know where I'm going
But I think I'll find a way

[Refrain: Jay Som]
The days just feel the same (Woo-oh, woo-oh-oh)
(But the feeling doesn't change)
The days just feel the same (Woo-oh, woo-oh-oh)
(But I think I'll find a way)

[Chorus: Jack Steadman & Jay Som]
I swear it's re-occuring
I guess I can't keep with it
I need sleep to keep me going
But I just can't seem to get it
It's like when you're never with me
The days just feel the same
And it's getting harder to see
All the things I need to change

[Post-Chorus: Jack Steadman & Jay Som]
All the things I need to change
I need to change

[Bridge: Jack Steadman & Jay Som]
Need to feel the weight to
Need to change my mind, my mind
I need to change
Need to feel the weight to
Need to change my mind, my mind
I need to change
Need to feel the weight to
Need to change my mind, my mind
I need to change
Need to feel the weight to
Need to change my mind, my mind
I need to change

[Outro: Jay Som]
I wake up, I wake up
I need to change
I wake up, I wake up
I need to change
I wake up, I wake up
I need to change
I wake up, I wake up
I need to change


Title: Slip Away

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Pretty face and pretty lips
Such a shame she hates to kiss
Never even know what goes on in her brain
And I'd rather tick her off the list

[Chorus]
You call her up, you call her up
And slip away, slip away, slip away


Title: Soren

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Miss your hair
I like the way you stare into my eyes
Most the time
The way you touch me is like a curse that can't be broken
But it hurts
Most of the time

[Chorus]
And if there was a place that I had to choose
Or a memory that fades that I cannot lose
If there was a place that I could call home
Before I die, you oughta know
It’d be in your arms tonight

[Verse 2]
The green in your eyes
Are like the leaves in the summer
And it changes with the weather
The pink in your cheeks
When you slightly lose your temper
Makes me love you even more

[Chorus]
And if there was a place that I had to choose
Or a memory that fades that I cannot lose
If there was a place that I could call home
Before I die, you oughta know
It'd be in your arms tonight
It'd be in your arms tonight


Title: Sorry

Lyrics:
[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Said I had to see you
But I don't and I won't
And I won't
To think I was just like you
All alone, skin to bone
Skin to bone

[Chorus]
And it hurts me
That you could be the one that deserved this even more
But you stayed in the same dark place that I adore
But you stayed for more
I guess that's what happens to the best of us
The best of us

[Verse 2]
I hope to come and see you
When your state's doing great
Doing great
A part of me feels for you
That I'm doing alright, and guess I've been feeling fine

[Chorus]
But it hurts me
That you could be the one that deserved this even more
But you stayed in the same dark place that I adore
But you stayed for more
I guess that's what happens to the best of us
The best of us

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
I never wanna think twice
With what could've been your life
And I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry

[Chorus]
It hurts me
That you could be the one that deserved this even more
But you stayed in the same dark place that I adore
But you stayed for more
I guess that's what happens to the best of us
The best of us

[Outro]
And I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry


Title: Space Cadet

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Feeling shit again
Haven't left my bed
Never brush my hair
And if you look me in the eyes you'll see that I don't care

[Verse 2]
You don't seem to understand
This candy floss made spacecraft
Took the dirt out from my brain
Threw them out to outer space

[Chorus]
Through the Milky Way
Past the morning sun
Pluto is light years away
And all our worries, they're all gone

[Verse 3]
Let loose, we live only for a little while
In hindsight, we'll die anyways
Extraterrestrial beings probably sittin' tight
Waiting to blow our brains away

[Chorus]
Through the Milky Way
Past the morning sun
Pluto is light years away
And all our worries, they're all gone

[Verse 4]
So quit being so negative
It's fine, don't be a temporary fix
You say I don't write happy songs
So I guess this is the first one

[Chorus]
Through the Milky Way
Past the morning sun
Pluto is light years away
And all our worries, they're all gone


Title: Spacing Out

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Can't you see, can't you notice?
Somehow tough and I'm pretty broken
Just because I'm fine doesn't mean I'm alright
And I need someone to say, "Okay"
I need someone to say, "It's fine

[Chorus]
I'm just stressing out
I need something to hold me
I need something to hold me
I'm just spacing out
I need something to catch me
I need something to catch me

[Verse 2]
Are you dumb, are you stupid?
Is it me, or is it pretty obvious?
Just because I don't talk, doesn't mean I go talking
‘Cause sometimes I keep to myself
And sometimes it helps with my brain

I'm just stressing out
I need something to hold me
I need something to hold me
I'm just spacing out
I need something to catch me
I need something to catch me
I'm just stressing out
I need something to hold me
I need something to hold me


Title: Speed Dial

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Oscar Lang]
Sit and talk
‘bout ourselves
I could talk for hours, I could talk for hours
Me and you
All alone
The world is ours, the world is ours

[Verse 2: beabadoobee]
If you stay
I would look
Into your eyes, into your eyes
Hand in hand
I know you will
Never lie, never lie

[Chorus: Oscar Lang]
Spark in your eyes
Makes me feel warm inside
I could spend my days lost in them
For all my life

[Verse 3: Oscar lang & beabadoobee]
Spilling drinks
Laugh and cry
I love your smile, I love your smile
Time with you
Is time I like
Stay for a while, stay for a while
Dreams at night
Filled with love
Your on speed dial, your on speed dial

[Chorus: Oscar Lang]
Spark in your eyes
Makes me feel warm inside
I could spend my days lost in them
Or all my life
