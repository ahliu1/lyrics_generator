Title: 7 Days Til Sunday

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
She said "Come over there's nobody home"
I went over, there was nobody home
But her light was on
Her light was on
And I'm not as drunk as I seem
But still I stood out there in the street
Throwing stones at her window
Like I saw somebody do on TV

[Chorus 1]
7 days til Sunday
7 days til Sunday
7 days til Sunday
7 days til Sunday
Until Sunday
Until Sunday
Until

[Verse 2]
She said "Come over there's nobody home"
She said "I know that's what I told you before
But here in New York, you don't need excuses to dress like a girl"
Sex, drugs and deceit
I guess she's not as frail as she seems
I pushed as hard as I could
But she said "That's okay because that's the way that I like it"

[Chorus 2]
7 days til Sunday
7 days til Sunday
7 days til Sunday
Ooh, 7 days til Sunday
Until Sunday
Until Sunday
Until

[Verse 3]
She said come over 'cause everyone's here
And I'm glad she had to make that clear
Smoking cigs on her roof
Laughing at the people on the train 'cause they're not like us
But I lost the drugs and I stayed too long
I got drunk and made fun of her band
But thank god it was Sunday and there's more than just one way
To ruin a one-night stand

[Chorus 3]
7 days til Sunday
7 days til Sunday
7 days til Sunday
Ooh, 7 days til Sunday
Until Sunday
Until Sunday
Until


Title: 8 AM

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Coco & Clair Clair]
Called out of work again
Fuck waking up at 8 am
The sun is high and so am I
Off sun rays and blue skies
See my neighbor across the street
I look at him, he smiles at me (me)
I wonder why I'm so sleepy
I think as I drink my coffee
Can’t wait to get back in my bed
With not a thought in my head
Don't care if it's not even noon
I’ll start the day again at 2
Maybe I'll lay out in the park (la la la la la la)
Slow down my beating heart (la la la la la)
Maybe I'll buy a new lipstick (la la la la la la)
Or watch a movie that's really sick (la la la la la)

[Chorus: Clair Clair]
All that's going through my head is
La la la la la
Nothing more and nothing less just
La la la la la
All that's going through my head is
La la la la la
Nothing more and nothing less just
La la la la la

[Verse 2: Coco]
My boss is onto me
Prolly mad cos he's ugly
I'm cruising down the street
And got Beach House blasting
Rolling the windows down
Wish today was everlasting
You can call me crazy, but I’m feelin’ lucky
I give you a call just to say something
But then my brain turned on
Realized I needed nothing
Sunroof is wide open, wind in my hair I'm chilling (la la la la la la, la la la la la)
This feeling is everything (la la la la la la)
What’s better than doing nothing (la la la la la)

[Chorus: Clair Clair]
All that's going through my head is
La la la la la
Nothing more and nothing less just
La la la la la


Title: 99.5

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
What if the truth is required but your tongue is dry and you can't get it out now?
What if you're floating away but you get too high and you can't come back down?
Up, up and away, looking back at the rest of the flock still down, down bad
What if you oughta go home but you bump again, and you bump again

[Chorus]
And ooh
Most of us just won't make it
Most of us just gotta fake it
But ninety is close and
Ninety nine is almost true
Ninety nine and a half, it just won't do
It just won't do
It just won't do, ooh, ooh, ooh
It just won't do

[Verse 2]
What if your man steps out and you're stuck with the junk and they're working on the clamp down?
Oh, I thought I told you before, you never take it so far that you can't take it back now
But if you want a fix, I'm a broken man, it's bad enough we exist on the stolen land
I said you just can't ignore the past, she said, "What the hell are you talking about? Baby, of course you can"

[Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Most of us just won't make it
Most of us just gotta take it
Someone right the wrongs or
Someone sing a song to kill my blues
Ninety nine and a half, it just won't do
Just won't do
Just won't do
Just won't do


Title: All a Dream

Lyrics:
Time to say goodbye to all my friends
I'm getting ready for the end
I’ll remember every song I ever heard
Every chord and every word

(Oooh ooooh)


Title: All The Way Through

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I'd like to be a bit like you
I'd like to have your problems too
I'd treat love like an act of charity
Now I watch as your eyes turn blue
As you floated across the room
And move from moment to moment of clarity

[Chorus]
You should know what to do
And maybe you do
You should know what to do
Well let's skip to your room
You should know what to do
When they were looking at you
They weren't really looking at you
They were looking all the way through you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, oh, ooh, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, oh, ooh, oh

[Verse 2]
I think that I'm a bit like you
Maybe more than you even knew and
If I could I would stick to you
Like glitter sticking into glue and
I would watch as your eyes turn blue
As we sat in our separate rooms
I swear her voice would too
If I could only find out who's

[Chorus]
You should know what to do
And maybe you do
You should know what to do
Well let's skip to your room
You should know what to do
When they were looking at you
They weren't really looking at you
They were looking all the way through you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, oh, ooh, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, oh, ooh, oh


Title: Anjela

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Standing in the kitchen
Wondering where Anjela's gone
She didn't even drive here
She couldn't have gotten very far

[Pre-Chorus]
What does it matter anyways?
I didn't like her anyways
I only let her crawl into my arms
I wasn't trying to lead anyone on
I was only trying to stay warm

[Chorus]
Oh Anjela
Can't stand the cold
And it's not summer anymore
I haven't seen the last of her

[Verse 2]
There was euphemisms and arrangements
There was alleged transgressions
She said, "I'm not very good at talking about this stuff
So nevermind"
She buried her face in the pillow

[Pre-Chorus]
What does it matter anyways?
She didn't like me anyways
I only thought because she climbed into my arms
But she wasn't trying to turn anyone on
She was only trying to stay warm

[Chorus]
Oh Anjela
Can't stand the cold
And it's not summer anymore
I haven't seen the last of her

[Chorus]


Title: Average Guy (Blame)

Lyrics:
I don't have much to say I'm an ordinary guy
Don't ask me how I feel about it, it never crossed my mind
The only thing that bothers me is how to spend my time
But all in all it's pretty good to be alive when you're an average guy

And I'm just an average guy
I'm just an average guy
I stay so warm at night
I get nervous whenever I'm alone
My girlfriend disappears for hours
I don't know where she goes
Lord only knows where I'd be without that girl
And everybody knows that love's the best thing in the world

For an average guy
And I'm just an average guy
I'm just an average guy
I stay so warm at night

I get on my knees every other day
Lord keep me out of trouble and keep me safe from pain
I get these feelings they're not easy to explain
But when you see me I'll have a smile on my face
Cause I'm an average guy
And I'm just an average guy
I'm just an average guy
I stay so warm at night

I'm just an average guy
I'm just an average guy
I'm just an average guy
I'm just an average guy


Title: Baby You Were There

Lyrics:
Sorry if I was misleading
It's not the color of your hair or the clothes that you wear
Baby, you were there
Oh, baby, you were there
Baby, you were there
Baby, you were there
Oh, baby, you were there
Oh
It is what it is and that's all it'll be
We're just wasting time so it might as well be me
You can call it anything you wanna
Just friends, it's complicated
I'm not gonna
Pay no mind to your apathy
Oh, baby you were there
Baby, you were there
Baby, you were there
Oh, baby you were there


Title: Benny and the Jetts

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Her eyes were green, her skin glistened
Talk all you want to, she never listens
She'll love for an instant but how quickly she forgets
And as she drove away
She was listening to Bennie and the Jets
To Bennie and the Jets

[Verse 2]
She'll walk by your window, you'll only catch a glimpse
She'll disappear like vapor, and leave a trail of hints
But all you'll really capture is that feeling in your chest
And as she drove away
She was listening to Bennie and the Jets
To Bennie and the Jets

[Verse 3]
She's the Poet's nightmare, she'll sink into your soul
She'll absorb your passion and turn it into coal
Well, I ain't no poet but I'll try like all the rest
I remember as she drove away
She was listening to Bennie and the Jets
To Benny and the Jets


Title: Better in the Dark

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
When I saw you standing there
With the dyed-up blonded hair
They said that you had clout
I said I didn't care
When the liquor was all clear
I could see you through the glass
There's something I could tell you
But I forgot to ask

[Chorus]
In the shadow of the stars
The lighter makes a spark
But I look better in the dark
I look better in the dark

[Verse 2]
Do you think it would be weird
If I dropped into a dream?
Always the first to know
Always the last to leave
If you're sober in the morning
We can always just pretend
That you're drunk on the way home
And the party didn't end

[Chorus]
When the sunlight meets the dawn
You'll see I'm not the one you want
'Cause I look better in the dark

[Outro]
The night is a thief some poet once wrote
That steals the colors from the day
It's kind of pretty if you like words but
They're not exactly true
Because there are colors at night
The burning red of passion
The angry green of jealousy
The ugly and terrifying black


Title: Big Black Void

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
One of these days and probably soon
I'm gonna go up to Heaven and meet my Lord
Gonna press that flame to the silver spoon
I'm gonna go up to Heaven and meet my Lord
One of these days I'm telling you, boy
I'm gonna go up to Heaven and meet my Lord
I'm gonna slip right into that big black void
I'm gonna go up to Heaven and meet my Lord

[Chorus]
(Ooh) Your rose is red but you're turning blue
(Ooh) Silver cord wrapped around your neck
As you dangle from the moon

[Verse 2]
Sold my body for all it was worth
I'm gonna go up to Heaven and meet my Lord
Still couldn't buy any peace on Earth
I'm gonna go up to Heaven and meet my Lord
You could sleep with a hundred girls
I'm gonna go up to Heaven and meet my Lord
No man alive ever fucked the world
I'm gonna go up to Heaven and meet my Lord

[Chorus]
(Ooh) I tried money, I tried drugs
(Ooh) There's no pill so translucent
Ain't no powder white enough

[Verse 3]
I heard it said, though they never told
I'm gonna go up to Heaven and meet my Lord
The nose of an angel is lined with gold
I'm gonna go up to Heaven and meet my Lord
And if I make it to holy ground
I'm gonna go up to Heaven and meet my Lord
I'm gonna bag it up, sell it by the pound
I'm gonna go up to Heaven and meet my Lord

[Chorus]
(Ooh) And if you find yourself in Hell
(Ooh) Kiss the devil on the lips
And you swear you would never tell

[Verse 4]
One of these days and it won't be long
I'm gonna go up to Heaven and meet my Lord
They're gonna glorify me in a tragic song
I'm gonna go up to Heaven and meet my Lord
One of these days I'm telling you, boy
I'm gonna go up to Heaven and meet my Lord
I'm gonna slip right into that big black void
I'm gonna go up to Heaven and meet my Lord


Title: Birds Dont Sing

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
She said "How could you joke at a time like this?
I know why, cause this is what you wanted all along now, isn't it?
I think that all you ever really ever wanted was a reason to complain
That never stopped you before, don't let it get in your way"
Those are her words, not mine
As far as I'm concerned, we could've had a good time
So, if you walk out that door in disgust
I guess there's nothing more to discuss

[Chorus]
Birds don't sing, they just fall from the sky
Girls don't call, and they never tell you why
That's just how they say goodbye
Goodbye

[Samples from Dangerously Yours]
(Over and over again)
("Well, um...yes!")
("You'd do that to a woman?")
("You don't sound 'a little sick' to me.")

[Verse 2]
Don't listen to my music, don't lie in my bed
Don't listen to the references to things that you might have actually said
'Cause those are my words, not yours
As far as I'm concerned, it could have been a lot worse
I wasn't trying to avoid the confrontation
She isn’t crying, she’s just making conversation

[Chorus]
Birds don't sing, they just fall from the sky
Girls don't call, and they never tell you why
That's just how they say goodbye
Goodbye

[Samples from Dangerously Yours]
(Over and over again)
("Well, um...yes!")
("You'd do that to a woman?")


Title: Blue Hair

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
She asked me how to be funny
But that's not something you can teach
What seemed so blue in the sunlight
By the night was a pale green

[Chorus]
And I tried to hold her
But it didn't really last long
And she's getting older
I guess she's gotta cut her blue hair off

[Verse 2]
She asked me if she was pretty
Well, it's clear that the girl's a fraud
There's really no way of winning
If in their eyes you'll always be a dumb blonde
[Chorus]
And she cried over nothing
So there was nothing I could do to stop
Her from cutting
Her beautiful blue hair off

[Verse 3]
It looked like cotton candy
And just as quick to get licked away
Last I heard she was living
With a boy who acts his age

[Chorus]
And I guess I'll just miss her
Even though she isn't even really gone
But things are just different
Ever since she cut her blue hair off


Title: Chocolate Ice Cream Land

Lyrics:
[Sample from "Penny and the Pennies" by Blossom Toes]
(Saturday, Sunday, for miles around)
(Saturday, Sunday, not much sound)

Maddie the villain, I keep it surreal
Twist my mustache make it bend like steel
Get the fuck back 'cause I pack the steel
Seems fake but it's real, like electric eels
So what the heck's the deal with these fake-ass foes
Keep acid on my tongue, make it decompose
You see my clothes, I'm draped in paisley
I sniff the rose, y'all push the daisies
And when I blow smoke y'all know what it's laced with
You fools want a tool, take fifty paces
If you think I'm cool, that's cool but face it
You couldn't be me even if we switched places
Shit talk sounds inaudible, the way that I lick shots
I call my fucking pistols my popsicles
M80, I aim to please
They try to aim at me, but only in the land of make-believe

(Living in a chocolate ice cream land)
(Living in a chocolate ice cream land)
(Living in a chocolate ice cream land)
(Down, down the road)

Love goes where Madison goes
I'm at the shows, I don't rap, I just float and glow
They ask how she does it, but no one knows
Like when the wine-glass shatters and there's no one's home
I got a crystal pistol with amber trim
Wrap it in my fist, bullets that can cut through rims
The velvet grip, the ruby scope
I'm not talking 'bout drugs when I shoot the dope
I'm not talking 'bout drugs when I drop the acid
Rappers act hard but they melt like plastic
They talk sheets like a bunch of fabric
And when there's no beats, they just rock the static
They freak at black magic
The laugh the track and tip a line to stop the fragments
But that was just a dream
They try to fuck with me, but only in the land of make-believe

(Living in a chocolate ice cream land)
(Living in a chocolate ice cream land)
(Living in a chocolate ice cream land)
(Down, down the road)

[Samples from "Beat-Bop" by K-Rob vs. Rammellzee, "Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" by DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince]


Title: Cigarettes out the Window

Lyrics:
[Intro: Frankie Cosmos]
Boy now who smokes cigarettes out that window
Boy now who smokes cigarettes out that window

[Verse 1: TV Girl]
My girl Liddy used to always smoke
Cigarettes when she couldn't sleep
She'd disappear for an hour and a half
And when she'd come back, she'd brush her teeth
But I could still smell it on her raggedy tee
And I could taste it on her lips when we kissed
Poor little Liddy used to always quit
But she never really quit
She'd just say she did

[Chorus: Frankie Cosmos]
Boy now who smokes cigarettes out that window (Ooh-ooh)
Boy now who smokes cigarettes out that window (Ooh-ooh)
Boy now who smokes cigarettes out that window (Ooh-ooh)
Boy now who smokes cigarettes out that window (Ooh-ooh)

[Verse 2: TV Girl]
My girl Liddy used to always smoke
Cigarettes when she couldn't sleep
I wonder what she did when she got done
I guess she'd just flick them out in the street
Poor little Liddy, she wishes it was dark
But it's never really dark in LA
The light from the billboard always shines
But it changed twelve times since you went away

[Chorus: Frankie Cosmos]
Boy now who smokes cigarettes out that window (Ooh-ooh)
Boy now who smokes cigarettes out that window (Ooh-ooh)
Boy now who smokes cigarettes out that window (Ooh-ooh)
Boy now who smokes cigarettes out that window (Ooh-ooh)

[Outro: Victor Jory]
You'll find moonlit nights strangely empty because when you call my name through them there'll be no answer
Rather melodramatic, aren't you?
You'll find moonlit nights strangely empty because when you call my name through them there'll be no answer
You mind if I smoke?
You'll find moonlit nights strangely empty because when you call my name through them there'll be no answer
(Ooh-ooh)
I always smoke with the theatre
You'll find moonlit nights strangely empty because when you call my name through them there'll be no answer
(Ooh-ooh)
Somehow it enhances the performance


Title: Come When You Call

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
The sound of mass confusion
Reverberated down the hall
Into the ears of a stoic roommate
Who put her headphones on
But in the space between the songs
(That's where she paid the most attention)
Beneath the crack on the door
(The candle flickered and got extinguished)
The reassuring hum of the freeway
As she drifted off to sleep
And it was five o'clock in the morning
You had no good reason to leave

[Chorus]
Ooh baby I'll come when you call (I'll come when you call)
I'll come when you call (I'll come when you call)
I'll come when you call (I'll come when you call)
I'll come but that's all (I'll come when you call)

[Verse 2]
Linda Ronstadt on the stereo
She was singing Warren Zevon
Hold me tighter, Carmelita
Make the night not last so long
And if it seems so peaceful now
(Why don't you wait until the morning light?)
And catch the eye of the stoic roommate
(As you leave without saying goodbye)
And if you're ever left to wonder
Why anything goes right
Thank the god of bad decisions
The queen of lonely nights

[Chorus]
Ooh baby I'll come when you call (I'll come when you call)
I'll come when you call (I'll come when you call)
I'll come when you call (I'll come when you call)
I'll come but that's all (I'll come when you call)

[Outro]
Why doesn't it always rain?


Title: Cut Chop Break Burn

Lyrics:
[Sample from Susan Christie's "Paint a Lady"]:

Tick tock
Time comes and then it's gone
Tick tock
In the end it's faced alone

Tick tock
Time comes and then it's gone
Tick tock
In the end it's faced alone

Tick tock
Time comes and then it's gone
Tick tock
In the end it's faced alone


Title: Cynical One

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I like looking at your eyes
Playing piano and staring out your window
In the middle of the night
From your house on the hill
I was hoping
Hoping that you wouldn’t forget me
But I know you will

[Chorus]
So don’t go around saying
There’s no such thing as love
You can’t go trading me places
Don’t forget that I, I am the cynical one

[Verse 2]
Wine and roses
Are fine, but I like the harder stuff
And I can still remember
When too much, too much was never enough

[Chorus]
So don’t go around saying
There’s no such thing as love
You can’t go trading me places
Don’t forget that I, I am the cynical one

[Outro]
Don’t forget that I, I am the cynical one
Don’t forget that I, I am the cynical one
Don’t forget that I, I am the cynical one


Title: Daughter of a Cop

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Sneaking the pillow under the sheets
I know a place where everyone meets
But she knows a place
Where the cops don't go
And she'd be the one if anyone knows

[Pre-Chorus]
If half the fun was to cut and run
And the other half was getting caught

[Chorus]
Then don't stop (don't stop)
She was the daughter of a cop
Don't stop (don't stop)
The daughter of a cop

[Verse 2]
Making love is an easy thing to do
And she didn't feel like pushing herself
But don't be fooled
'Cause it could have been you
Or him or anyone else

[Pre-Chorus]
If half the fun was to cut and run
And the other half was getting caught

[Verse 3]
Then when the fix comes in
She'll get a slap on the wrist
And leave you in a cell to rot

[Chorus]
So don't stop (don't stop)
She was the daughter of a cop
Don't stop (don't stop)
The daughter of a cop

[Outro]
Don't stop (don't stop)
The daughter of a cop


Title: Death of a Party Girl

Lyrics:
[Excerpt from "Crime Classics"]
Narrator: "She was found wandering through the city clothed in night apparel. She drank and raved over her broken hopes. She was found groping in the dark through the halls of public buildings. And one day, she was no longer young."

Henrietta: "Sit with me for a while. Talk to me. Where did you go, when you went from me long ago? You always go away! And there's always the sound of you going away. And why do I come here? And remember. Remember what? Remember what?"

[Verse 1]
She was sexy she was sweet
Running barefoot in the street
Sipping wine out of a flask
Drinking vodka by the glass
Yeah she used to knock 'em back
As fast as they would line them up

Still sexy but she's sad
And the headache's coming on
Only dancing out of habit
She doesn't recognize the song
How can the nights be getting long
When time feels like it's speeding up

She used to crush the pill right between her fingers
It used to kill the feeling but now the feeling lingers
And she did the drugs for fun
But now she does them just to stay up

Just to stay up [x4]

[Sample]
Henrietta: "And that's all you get. Buy me a drink...Buy me a drink!...Kitty."
Kitty: "You've had enough."
Henrietta: "I know. But you're a friend of mine..."
Kitty: "No drink."
Henrietta: "Lend me two dollars."
Kitty: "I don't have it!"
Henrietta: "Then I'll lend you some! Hundreds!"
Kitty: "You ought to go home."

[Verse 2]
Incognito at the bar
She could tell he was a star
By the way he wore his baseball cap
Slung low across his eyes
While beauties live and die
These playboys stay forever young

Which handsome stylish rake
Puts his hands around her waist
As she stumbles up the stairs
In a state of perfect grace?
They would hold her just to hold her
But now it's 'cause she can't stand up

Running for the pleasure
Wearing down the flesh
And she has to go to sleep now
When she used to go to bed
Eyes closed because she felt it
But now it's 'cause she can't wake up
She can't wake up [x5]

[Sample]
Henrietta: "There, young man. Did you enjoy your dance?...Then buy me a drink."
Man 1: "Well, what's your pleasure?"
Henrietta: "Oh, Kitty! A gin!...Gin is my pleasure."
Man 1: "Well, drink away!"
Henrietta: "Stop it. You're making fun of me. Stop it. I'll kill you."

[Outro]
Henrietta: "No one will ever know. No one will ever know."
Man 2: "What?"
Henrietta: "This place we're in. The time..."


Title: Diet-Coke

Lyrics:
Out on the porch so quiet
Nothing on the tv tonight
Nowhere in the world to go
We went to see the midnight show

Sticky floors and torn-up seats
In the lobby you got something to eat
Lights go down, the screen starts to glow
You came back with a diet coke

Oh oh oh...

You missed the entire first scene
By the credits we were both asleep
I was lying next to you in a dream
The lights came on and someone told us to leave

Oh oh oh...

Your house was as dark as the room
Not a single word was spoke
3am and I'm all alone
Just a memory and a diet coke

Your house was as dark as the room
Not a single word was spoke
3am and I'm all alone
Just a memory and a diet coke

Oh oh oh...


Title: Do It To Ya

Lyrics:
[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I don't ever lie
I distort the truth to the rhythm
And have a fetish for beautiful women who just don't care
And you don't have to decide
'Cause you can always change your opinion, on a whim
Like the colors in your hair
And I don't really know what she's sad about
'Cause everybody knows what the jams about
And when they talk about love
You know exactly what they mean
To say, You should've guessed it
You don't just say it, you just suggest it
You just accept it, and pretend you're on TV
But not me

[Chorus]
'Cause I just wanna do it to ya
I just wanna do it to ya
I just wanna do it to ya
I only wanna do it to ya
Just like you do it to me

'Cause I just wanna do it to ya
I just wanna do it to ya
I only wanna do it to ya
Like you do it to me

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Girls, have you ever had a friend
That you just get with every now and then
Or maybe just once after a bunch of drinks
Because you like to stall
And I'm not that kinda guy
And you're not that kind of girl
I'm a liar, and a pervert with a heart of gold
Who does what he's told
And what happens next you can probably guess
My hand in her hair and her head on my chest
But when the morning came
Everything felt strange
She sat on the edge of the bed and got changed
So I didn't even ask for her number
'Cause hey, I didn't mean to suggest we were lovers
But I'll keep you in the back of my heart
In that special place where things only look good in the dark

[Chorus]
'Cause I just wanna do it to ya
I just wanna do it to ya
I only wanna do it to ya
Just like you do it to me

'Cause I just wanna do it to ya
I just wanna do it to ya
Let's pretend we're on TV

(Instrumental)


Title: Don’t Say No

Lyrics:
I wander into the conversation
I'll move closer to you
It's coming down to that old confrontation
Only the faces are new
But that's just how it goes tonight
It only takes a little lie
Just in case a lightbulb breaks and sparks fall on our head
Skip the heartache, skip the sorrow
Real life will resume tomorrow
Don't regret what got you here
Or you might as well be dead (I need you)

I want you, don't say no
I want you, don't say no
I want you, don't say no
Don't say no, don't say no
I want you, don't say no
I want you, don't say no
I want you, don't say no
Don't say no, don't say no

There's no time for a hundred indecisions
There's no time for visions or revisions
But let's not get ovеrly philosophic
And better men than mе have nailed by appealing to your logic
So bless the father, bless the son
Bless the priest and bless the nun
They obey some higher cause that's lost on you and me
See the cat, see the cradle
If you're willing, if you're able
Noone ever got very far by begging on their knees (I need you)

I want you, don't say no
I want you, don't say no
I want you, don't say no
Don't say no, don't say no
I want you, don't say no
I want you, don't say no
I want you, don't say no
Don't say no, don't say no

I want you, don't say no
I want you, don't say no
I want you, don't say no
Don't say no, don't say no
I want you, don't say no
I want you, don't say no
I want you, don't say no
Don't say no, don't say no


Title: (Do The) Act Like You Never Met Me

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Gather around, everybody
Have you heard the latest craze?
Put your hands in your pockets
And look the other way
Remember those times when you were laughing
And naked on my couch?
Pretend it never happened
Politely smile as we turn around

[Chorus]
And do the act like you never met me
Do the act like you never met me
Do the act like you never met me
And slowly walk away

[Verse 2]
The hidden kisses
The clumsy conspiratory glance
But I don't really mind it, though
I always like the way you danced
It's so easy to do
So much simpler than the one we did before
Just point out your toe
At someone you know
And pretend that they're not

[Chorus]
And do the act like you never met me
Do the act like you never met me
And do the act like you never met me
And slowly walk away

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Slide to the left
Now slide to the right
Now tell me once again
How I was a really great guy
And dip to right
Now shimmy to the left
It's 3 o'clock in the morning
Don't answer my texts
Take a step back and
Take a couple more
Now one more sorry look
Before you walk out that door
Arch your back
When you spend the night with him
Bounce around a while
Never talk to me again

[Chorus]
That's how you do the
Act like you never met me
So do the act like you never met me
Do the act like you never met me
And slowly walk away


Title: Easier to Cry

Lyrics:
Cigarette between her fingers
And a drink in her hand
She thought about the days
When her looks were still in demand
And wondered where the time had gone
When did everything go wrong

No more flowers at her door
No more phone calls to wait up for

And she just wanted to die
But it was easier, it was easier
To cry, cry
To cry, cry

Remembered fingers running through her hair as she wept
Got up to fix another drink
And cursed the memory she kept
When Jack would ease her heavy heart
And Jim would keep her from the dark
Woke up in her clothes and she smiled
And said romance was out of style

She just wanted to die
But it was easier, it was easier
To cry, cry
To cry, cry

They’re just tears for the cause
Tracks for the lost
Betrayed by the heart
Waiting for sorrow to dissolve

But it’s so easy to
It's so easy to
...
To cry, cry x5


Title: Electric Kool Aid

Lyrics:
Acid, my name and reputation
Just a foot soldier in the fated nation
Dealin' dope to these no-hope kids
And living life like a paid vacation
I don't advertise, I just patch addictions
They all wanna rock like Twisted Sister
But no prescriptions, I got what they need
From the top CEO to the lowliest fiend
I make a lot of money off of so-called junk
And they don't give a fuck if it's too much cut
Nah man they would crawl through the mud
Just to get a little taste, coughin' up blood
In the land of the waves, weed gets laced
Dragons get chased
You know what they say
You take one for the pain, two for the sorrow
Take three more if you don't wanna see tomorrow

[Sample from "MC Hustler" by Prince Paul, "Push It" by Salt-N-Pepa, "Love's Gonna Get'cha (Material Love)" by Boogie Down Productions]

From grass to ash, dust gets puffed
And these fiends get killed by the things they love
But I don't got time to get too philosophic
I don't make friends, I make a profit
Still got a brand that's on my pocket
The Feds can't stop it
When the block gets hot, I retreat to my yacht
It's hard to eat with these fucked-up streets
That's why you do what you can to make these dead ends meet
I've seen rich girls cop X pills on their dad's credit
I've seen priests get high and go to heaven
Cops pop molly, grannies smoke crack
They got one thing in common: they always come back
I just back up the alley, pull up on the canvas
In a black Caddy 'til they kick the habit
I've got 'em hooked and I don't care if they kick it
I invested drug money in that rehab clinic, bitch

[Sample from a 1950s anti-marijuana commercial]:
"Lookie here."
"What's that?"
"It's heroin."
"Will it make me sick like the reefers did?"
"Well go on and try it. I dare ya."
"How much does it cost?"
"This one ain't gonna cost you nothin', it's free. Go on. I dare ya."

Tabs, dabs, big bricks of hash
Big chunks of wax, big shards of glass
Coke with no crash, too bad it don't last
Flip the mattress, see my stacks of cash
Say "one more hit then you'll quit it"
Bitch, who ya kidding, pick up the phone, come and get it
Catnip, jenkem, whatever you desire
If I say I didn't have it then I'm probably a liar
But I can take you higher
Higher than a bird on a wire
Hair on fire like Richard Pryor
Peace to sand, giving some smokin' a little bit of ritalin
Have you feelin' like an upstanding citizen
Candy is dandy, but crystal's king
Got that shit that'll make you sing
Got that shit that'll flick your bean
'Til your skin turns green
And your hair falls out like you're Mr. Clean
Got tar so black it absorbs the light
Got lines so white they distort your sight
Got leaves so green that they're almost blue
Plus I pack a MAC-10, and my aim is true
Got these psychedelic pills, the best of all
One makes you large and one makes you small
One makes you crazy, one makes you sane
And I don't care which you get, I get paid the same

"It was just a business matter to Duke, though Marty didn't find it out until later."
"But that stuff costs too much to waste it."
"That's right, kid. You oughta go on the needle."
"That oughta hold me for a while. I hocked my camera to get this stuff."


Title: Fallout

Lyrics:
["You need to know about fallout. Everybody needs to know. Yes, this does mean you. Watch and listen. One day, these facts may save your life."]

Maddie Maddie Acid
You can spell it with a double D
Yeah I got tits but these fuckers can't fuck with me
'Cause luckily their fuckery is out of my purview
Put the mic down like it's past the curfew
But fuck 'em, they're just a bunch of spoiled brats
Hold the musket give 'em all a blast from the past
But these crabs couldn't act in my class
I don't give a fuck just don't put them in a cast
Like they made a bad batch
And that's being generous so give 'em a groove
You can use all degenerates
Kill, go ham
With a good-ass gram at these Confederate degenerates
You can't fuck with this, I'm just too lucid
Y'all got flutes I got tubas
Y'all got guns I got bazookas
Y'all got nukes I got the doomsday device and I press the button twice

Madison Acid but they call me M80
Everyone says I rap good for a lady
But if they say that I'm just a girl then I say "fuck the world"
And give 'em all that makes 'em jump and twirl
And that's what I call ballet
Shoot at the ground and watch 'em do a sashay
'Cause I'll rock it 'til their eye sockets turn violet
Now they're telling me to stop the violence
But I say let it bleed, trust that to mean
Leaves you with a wound you couldn't soothe with a medic team
No editing it's raw and uncut
Yep, the only cut's just a knife to your gut
They got me going kamikaze, Nagasaki
Sherman's March with a word that's hard but effective
Question later and assault 'em first
Then when I finish on the mic then I salt the earth


Title: Fire

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
If you wanna get higher
Just let me know if it's the pink or the blues
If you're tired
I had the speed somewhere in my shoes
I know you were lyin'
When you said you'd be with me in the end
Guess I know where I'll find ya

[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh-ooh
And if I see you in Hell
I won't mind the fire
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
I won't mind the fire
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
If you're wired
Just even out with the booze
And if I'm required
To lie awake so I can look after you
I wouldn't mind it
Just wish we had time
So don't go killing thе vibe
Baby, everyonе's dying

[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh-ooh
And if I see you in Hell
I won't mind the fire
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
I won't mind the fire
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
I won't mind the fire
Fire, fire, fire
I won't mind the fire
Fire, fire, fire
I won't mind the fire

[Bridge]
Every high you chase (Fire)
Every glass you break (Fire)
Every moan you make (Fire)
Every walk of shame (I won't mind the fire)
I can hear you say (Fire)
As you flailed on the stage (Fire)
How we're born in a cage (Fire)
On some rock out in space (I won't mind the fire)
With no plan to escape (Fire)
Always running in place (Fire)
As we kick and we rage (Fire)
All the difference it makes (I won't mind the fire)
Whether clean or behaved (Fire)
Or debauched or defaced (Fire)
All the sinners and saints (Fire)
Holding hands in the grave (I won’t mind the fire)
Neither lost, neither saved (Fire)
Neither pleasure, nor pain (Fire)
Nothing spent, nothing gained (Fire)
Nothing still, nothing changed (I won't mind the fire)
No nirvana attained (Fire)
And no karma exchanged (Fire)
Nothing real, nothing fake (Fire)
Nor revealed, nor explained (I won't mind the fire)

[Outro]
No, no
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
I won't, won't mind the fire
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
I won't mind
I won't mind the fire

Lyrics:
["That is the end of Side 1 of this record. You can flip over now!"]


Title: Fool in love

Lyrics:
I mean we'll get through one way or the other-
(Bacon and Cheese) 3x
Here we go
(shoulda knew the consequences right from the-
He'd use me for my money, and then break my neart)
I used to be in love with this guy named Sam
I don't know why cause he had the head like that of a clam
And I shoulda knew the consequences right from the start
That he'd use me for my money, and then break my heart

But like a fool in love, like a fool in love
Yeah I fell for his game, I fell for his game
Like a fool in love, but like a fool in love, I fell for his game
But I got mine, so I show no shame
(I got mine)
And I used to be in love with this guy named Joe I don't know why then he'd tell me he'd never know
And guys like joe they just don't stay
They get picked up by the breeze and they blow away
But like a fool in love, like a fool in love

I fell for his game
Yeah I fell for his game
But like a fool in love, like a fool in love, I fell for his game
I got mine, so I show no shame
(I got mine, so I show no shame)


Title: For You

Lyrics:
[Intro]
Dating Courtesy: A girl is right to assume her date
Will perform little acts of courtesy
Which are his privilege (For you)
If you are smart, you will allow him
To open doors and hold chairs
Don't barge on ahead like a baby elephant (For you)
You'll get attention, all right
But it won't be favorable (For you)
It is correct to pause and let him know
You expect him to act like a gentleman
He'll love it and think you're a lady (For you)
And in return, it will flatter his masculine ego

[Bridge]
For you (For you)
For you, I wonder if
For you, I wonder if
For you, I wonder if
For you, for you (For you)

[Verse 1]
Excuse me for a second
While I bang my head against this wall
And I'm starting to suspect
You don't intend to do what you say at all
Forgive your loyal sycophant
For leaving lipstick stains upon your shoes

[Chorus]
(For you) And I wasted all my favorite melodies for you
And watched best friends turn to enemies for you
You heard I like the bad girls, baby, maybe that's true
For everybody else except—

[Refrain]
For you (For you)
For you, I wonder if
For you (For you)
For you, I wonder if
For you (For you)
For you, I wonder if
For you (For you)
For you, I wonder if

[Verse 2]
Excuse me, miss, but isn't this
Your naked body in my bed?
And how come it always felt like
You were taking something away
When you were giving head?
And it's a promise and a threat to say the F-word
So be careful who you screw

[Chorus]
(For you) And I used up all this latent energy for you
Tell me was everything you ever said to me just for you?
Still thinking there was something in a girl's underwear
That could change me, like I was still in middle school, like a fool

[Refrain]
For you (For you)
For you, I wonder if
For you (For you)
For you, I wonder if
For you (For you)
For you, I wonder if
For you (For you)
For you, I wonder if

[Verse 3]
(For you) Lonesome poets throwing glitter in their hair
(For you) Doing somersaults and exploding in mid-air
(For you) But you don't ever notice, or you don't care, or both
And when they take off all their clothes
Were they still not close enough—?

[Refrain]
For you (For you)
For you, I wonder if
For you (For you)
For you, I wonder if
For you (For you)
For you, I wonder if
For you (For you)
For you, I wonder if


Title: Girls Like Me

Lyrics:
They got a name for girls like me
They got a name, but no one wants to say it
They write songs about girls like me
When I'm around, no one wants to play ‘em
They'd sell their soul for a girl like me, and wonder why
They resent a girl like me 'cause I
Don't even have to try

Girls like me
Don't even have to try

It takes a nation of angry young men, and adolescent pretension
They scream poems at the top of their heads, as if they could get my attention
It takes more for a mythical beast like me to die
They think it's easy for a girl like me 'cause I
Don't even have to try

Girls like me
Don't even have to try


Title: Grapes Upon the Vine

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
My hair won't fall out, though I may go gray
I may forgive but I won't admit
That any hope it was sunken yet
Beauty faded or flowers dead
Maybe the sun was aligned but the moon was wrong
And stars don't lie but they do reflect
They do neglect sometimes to tell the whole truth, baby

[Chorus]
There ain't no check within your mailbox
So don't go changing with the times
There ain't no Kool-Aid in your poison anymore
There ain't no comfort in the bottle
For a grape upon a vine

[Post-Chorus]
(You can't shove it out)
(You can't shove it out)
(You can't shove it out)
(You can't shove it out)

[Verse 2]
(Even though) And even though we were too young to know
If lovers loved like us before
We can let it slide and both agree
It was only you and me
And I may give up, though I won't concede
But it isn't fate that shakes the trees
It's the ancient forces of boredom and lust and greed, now baby

[Chorus]
Ooh, there ain't no check within your mailbox
There's too much sand upon the slide
There ain't no mirrors in this funhouse anymore
There ain't no comfort in the bottle
For a grape upon a vine

[Post-Chorus]
(You can't shove it out)
(You can't shove it out)
(You can't shove it out)
(You can't shove it out)
(Said you'd go)


Title: Hang On

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I don't understand your green eyes
They sure looked blue to me
You could stay we could watch the sea rise
Find shade in some raging heat
I know that my face is ugly
I've known since I was seventeen
That there ain't no god above me
Looking out for a boy

[Pre-Chorus]
Who's life's so wrong
So wrong
So wrong

[Chorus]
I don't know, you just do what you can
To hang on
Hang on
You just do what you can to delude yourself and stay strong (To delude yourself and stay strong)
But hang on
You found someone to hang on to
If it ain't tied down you just take what you can and move on (Take what you can and move on)

[Verse 2]
Please don't explain your tattoos
The snake with the inverted cross
'Cause when you lay it down beside me
They were neither down or up
I saw how your lips were shining
Leaving stains upon a silver cup
Dear lord could you please remind me
Why it is you would let me sleep

[Pre-Chorus]
For so long
So long
So long

[Chorus]
I don't know, you just do what you can
To hang on
Hang on
You just do what you can to delude yourself and stay strong (To delude yourself and stay strong)
You hang on
You found someone to hang on to
If it ain't tied down you just take what you can and move on (Take what you can and move on)

[Outro]
But hang on (Hang on)
Hang on
You hang on
Hang on
Hang on
Hang on (Hang on)
Hang on (Hang on)
Hang on (Hang on)
Hang on (Hang on)


Title: Hate Yourself

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
You, you'd fall in love with anyone
I think you'd fall in love with anyone
Who fell in love with you
And they frequently do
So take comfort
Cruel comfort
Before you start to wonder
How you got locked inside your room

[Chorus]
And how long will it
Take before you start to hate yourself and go
Straight to the arms of someone else and I'll just
Wait 'til those arms belong to me and I'm not
Saying that you love me
I'm not saying any
Thing

[Verse 2]
Tell me, do you let them down gently?
Does it only make it harder?
To let the feeling linger
To drag it out a little longer
Does it put your mind at ease?
But you're the one who brought 'em here
You're the one who has to take 'em when you leave

[Chorus]
And how long will it
Take before you start to hate yourself and go
Straight to the arms of someone else and I'll just
Wait 'til those arms belong to me and I'm not
Saying that you love me
I'm not saying any
Thing

[Chorus]
And how long will it
Take before you start to hate yourself and go
Straight to the arms of someone else and I'll just
Wait 'til those arms belong to me and I'm not
Saying that you love me
I'm not saying any


Title: Heaven Is a Bedroom

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
And I remember how the pillows felt like clouds
Or was it the other way around?
And how your neighbor came in to yell at you
When the party got too loud
And when I snuck into your living room
And I wished that you would follow
At first you didn't but then you did
And it was already tomorrow
And you told me how you had an uncle
Who played the villain in those movies
And how he died and then you cried
You apologized profusely
I was nervous that this was good as I could ever feel
And I was right

[Chorus]
I confess to thinking sex was my salvation
Really they just start with the letter S
You'll forgive me for thinking heaven was her bedroom
It's as close as I would ever get
As close as I would ever get

[Verse 2]
And I'll always remember picking up
My favorite records from your apartment
Kissing you before you left me for New York
Weren't you a princess, or an heiress
Or just the daughter of a rich man?
In this land of constant sunshine
I thought you'd never have to work
New York City's cold and when you love someone
You should hold on to them so tightly
Till you crush them, or they wriggle from your grasp
You don't just stand there and say nothing
But at least I learned my lesson

[Chorus]
And I confess to thinking sex was my salvation
Really they just start with the letter S
You'll forgive me for thinking heaven was her bedroom
It's as close as I would ever get
As close as I would ever get

[Bridge]
If I ever make it to New York
Like I said that I would
Would it do me any good?
If I ever make it to New York
Like I told you on the phone

[Chorus]
And I confess to thinking sex was my salvation
When really they just start with the letter S
You'll forgive me for thinking heaven was her bedroom
It's as close as I would ever get
As close as I would ever get
As close as I would ever get
As close as I would ever get
As close as I would ever get
As close as I would ever get


Title: Heaven Over our Heads

Lyrics:
[Intro]
And right now, baby, it's alive

[Verse 1]
Count up the angels and then how many died
And how many heads they had to step all over just to get inside
But it's alright
I said, "It's alright"
You counted cards, you cut the deck, but they rig the game
Still I would hold you tightly to my chest and I'd show no shame
No shame
I'd do it all again

[Chorus]
And I just wonder sometimes
If heaven's over our heads

[Verse 2]
But I had some fun and I made some love in exotic places
Though I may have forgotten some names, I recall the faces
In my dreams
Out of reach
And I brokе some promises and refusеd to make amends
And I had my heart broke seven times and I lost some friends
But it's alright
What's the matter in the end?

[Chorus]
And I just wonder sometimes
If heaven's over our heads
And I just wonder sometimes
If heaven's over our heads

[Bridge]
I want it to shine on me
All over me
Even in my troubled soul
I want it to shine on me

[Verse 3]
Why must we struggle so as we try to do what's right?
Just a bunch of cockroaches just a-runnin' from the light
From the light
Shines upon our heads
And I may be stupid and I may be selfish and I may be wrong
But still, it's such a short time you were here
And such a long time you'll be gone
Scattered to the wind

[Outro]
And I just wonder sometimes
I just wonder sometimes
I just wonder sometimes
If heaven's over our heads


Title: Her and Her Friend

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I think it's funny how you could find yourself alone
With someone else in an ideal situation
Without a shred of good intentions between you
Much less a decent explanation
I couldn't tell you why she summoned me
Sometimes you get lucky
And they think that you were someone else
I can't remember what she said
Was she trying to tell me something
Or talking to herself?

[Chorus]
Go upstairs don't close the door
Why don't you give her what she's asking for?
Spill the drink onto the bed
That's just between her and her friend

[Verse 2]
But it made it hard to sleep
'Til her head felt even worse
And I hope that she felt miserable
When it was time to go to work
Her and her friend
Just did it as revenge
So any excess pain you feel
Isn't any consequence
But don't feel bad
'Cause you didn't stand a chance
You can make a hasty exit
That's how they handle it in France
Little consolation
Even if you always knew it
So any nasty things I say
Are purely therapeutic

[Chorus]
Go upstairs don't close the door
Why don't you give her what she's asking for?
Spill the drink onto the bed
That's just between her and her friend
Close the door, leave on the light
And kiss her for a little while
The liquor soaked into the sheets
She said, "It's getting late, you'd better leave"

[Outro]
I'm not budging until you tell me why
Please, go
Not until you look me straight in the eye and tell me why
Go away and never come back again
Go away, please, go away
Go away, please, go away...


Title: Higher Ground

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
This old world, it ain't my home
Nice place to visit, but you wouldn't stay
A few more risings and settings of the sun
And I would cross my legs and be on my way

[Chorus]
You can look up to me, baby
And I might see you looking down
'Cause there ain't no higher ground
There ain't no higher ground
[Interlude]
Upon the pretty cross
'Course I'm bad
Mister everybody tell their testimony
Why won't they say anything now?
Yeah, Lord

[Verse 2]
Listen, baby, you ain't my friend
Even though we float together down this raging flood
You could rip your dress and add fuel to the fire
But you can't take the smoke out of these dirty lungs

[Chorus]
Might be Heaven up above us
But even if it could be found
There ain't no higher ground
There ain't no higher ground
There ain't no higher ground
There ain't no higher ground

[Interlude]
Upon the pretty cross
'Course I'm bad
Mister everybody tell their testimony
Why won't they say anything now?
Yeah, Lord


Title: I Don’t Care

Lyrics:
(Verse)
Everyone's talking 'bout the times ahead
As far as I'm concerned, we're already dead
The funeral is over
The world's gone mad
Everyone's concerned
But I'm happy as a clam

(Chorus)
'Cause I don't care
(Ooh)
I don't care
(Ooh)
I don't care
(Ooh)
I don't care
(Ooh)

(Verse)
I smoke a pack of Reds and drink a six-pack everyday
I wanna stay sane and there ain't no better way
People call me crazy
They call me a cynic
So give me some advice and I'll tell you where to stick it

(Chorus)
Because I don't care
(Ooh)
I don't care
(Ooh)
I don't care
(Ooh)
I don't care
(Ooh)

(Verse)
They say, read this, feel this, do this, do that
Eat right, exercise or you'll get fat
Get happy, get pissed, PCs and desist
Don't slit your wrist, it's a blessing to exist
It's a lesson to be learned, penny saved, penny earned
Have some kids, it's your turn
Have a heart, do your part
Get smart, get informed
Protest the war
Play the hand your dealt
We're only trying to help

(Verse)
But I don't really listen, I hear it all the time
It all sounds the same, who will take the blame?
I'll gladly be the villain if it gives you peace of mind
Call me a pathetic because I don't really mind

(Chorus)
And I don't care
(Ooh)
I don't care
(Ooh)
I don't care
(Ooh)
I don't care
(Ooh)

(Verse)
The SATs are unfair
(I don't really care)
There's toxins in the air
(I don't really care)
The market dropped a million shares
(I don't really care)
The people are oppressed, but I couldn't care less

(Chorus)
'Cause I don't care
(Ooh)
I don't care
(Ooh)
I don't care
(Ooh)
I don't care
(Ooh)

I don't care
(Ooh)
I don't care
(Ooh)
I don't care
(Ooh)
I don't care
(Ooh)
Yeah


Title: If You Want It

Lyrics:
[Intro]
Hello, It's Me
Hello, It's Me
Hello, It's Me
Hello, It's Me

[Verse 1]
You wander into the bedroom
You're drunk, we've done this before
You stumble over like 3 seconds later
And kick your boots on to the floor
I can hardly see your eyes
You forgot to put your hair up
I can see you've learned some tricks
From those boys over in Europe
But still, it kinda makes me glad
To see how quick we fall into those old rhythms and patterns

[Chorus]
If you want it, you got it
You only want it when you're drunk
My friends say you're obnoxious
You're not so bad when we're alone

[Verse 2]
Morning comes
I know how the next part goes
One last dance
Then you delete me off your phone
In the hallway
Your eyes stay on the ground
Doesn't bother me because when the weekend rolls around

[Chorus]
You'll want it, and you'll get it
You only want it when your friends have all been bedded
You'll be outside smoking on the porch
"Come in", I'll say, "I'll give you shelter from the storm"


Title: I’ll Be Faithful

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Don't move, your lover is calling
Or did they just let the sirens ring
As the bombs were falling?
And all of these boys would just do like you say so
And if you tried to leave the room
They would grab your ankles

[Chorus]
But ooh (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah)
It doesn't matter what you do
I'll be faithful
I'll be faithful
I'll be faithful (I'll be, I'll be)
I'll be faithful

[Verse 2]
Was it love or art or was it drugs or something?
Don't tell me every hole you could notch on a belt
Added up to nothing
It was water or wine or whatever you paid for
And you could spit right in my drink
And I'd be grateful

[Chorus]
But ooh (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah)
Doesn't matter what you do
I'll be faithful
I'll be faithful (I'll be faithful, woah yeah)
I'll be faithful (I'll be, I'll be)
I'll be faithful (I'll be, I'll be faithful)

[Bridge]
You thought that you were Axl or Iggy or Jimi or Janice or Johnny or Sidney
But really baby you weren't anything like that
Still, you would smile like a little brat
As you donned your jacket and they would swoon
And you would laugh and they would watch themselves
As they watched you looking back
Just skip the mass, you can keep the faith
You can sleep for days on a golden lawn
You can swear to God for just one second
How you could see heaven through this smog
And you would tell how you transcended in the back seat of a car
As you said a prayer for every derelict that got caught beneath the stars

[Chorus]
But, hey (Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah)
If you say so
I'll be faithful (Ooh)
I'll be faithful (Faithful, yeah, yes I will)
I'll be faithful (I'll be faithful)
I'll be faithful (Unto you)
I'll be faithful (Yeah, I'll be)
I'll be faithful (I'll be)
I'll be faithful (Faithful, yeah)
I'll be faithful (Faithful, I'll be faithful)


Title: I’m Someone Else

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Dance me over, to the dark side of the gym
The drinks have all been emptied, the lights have all been dimmed
That's what you wanted, to rip him limb to limb

[Pre-Chorus]
I’ll be fine, just worry about yourself

[Chorus]
Cause I'm someone else
I'm someone else
I’m someone else
I'm someone else

[Verse 2]
Why even bother with that sympathetic stuff?
The confetti's decomposing, the band is packing up
And then it ends and leaves us (left us) deeply unimpressed

[Pre-Chorus]
That can't be good for someone's mental health

[Chorus]
But I'm someone else
I'm someone else
I'm someone else
I’m someone else

[Verse 3]
I need some time to prepare for the big investigation
I need an alibi to confront every potential complication
I’ll need to get a haircut and buy some brand new clothes (fancy shoes)
And keep that smile plastered on
What else could I do
But rely on those excuses
That have got me through the years?
I'll never be convicted
By a (of the) jury of my peers

Ooh ooh ah
Ooh ooh ah


Title: It Almost Worked

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Everyone looks the same in this town
You can hardly tell the difference
She stayed at home and figured out how
To will herself out of existence

[Chorus]
She gave it a try
She closed her eyes
She didn't know how it'd feel
She just hoped that it wouldn't hurt
It almost worked

[Verse 2]
They lie right to your face in this town
But what did you expect?
She wishes that she could have seen what they saw
That left them so unimpressed

[Chorus]
So she gave it a try
She started to cry
She said to herself, "Well, at least it could have been worse"
And it almost worked


Title: It Evaporates

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Where does it go
When love dries up?
Forms into clouds
And rains on someone else
It drips off the fingertips
And soaks into the clothes
Clogs up the gutters
And ruins everyone’s shoes

[Pre-Chorus]
And then
It drains into the street
Then it sits there in the heat
Then

[Chorus]
It evaporates
Ooh ooh ooh
It evaporates
Ooh ooh ooh

[Verse 2]
What can you do
When a girl doesn’t like you?
You can steal a lock of her hair
And try your luck at voodoo
You can sigh, you can pick the petals off of a flower
And when that doesn’t work
You can just cry in the shower

[Pre-Chorus]
And the tears
Circle round the drain
They’ll float through the pipelines
And then drift out to the sea
Then they’ll get whipped up by a breeze

[Outro]
And evaporate
Ooh ooh ooh
It evaporates
Ooh ooh ooh
It evaporates
Ooh ooh ooh
It evaporates
Ooh ooh ooh


Title: I Thought You Were Cool

Lyrics:
[Samples from "Better Dayz" by 2Pac, "Watch Roger Do His Thing" by Main Source]

You know the place
Echo Park Lake
Back, way back, we used to hang in '08
And I would watch as you watched as I played guitar
Blowing smoke rings out the window of your car
Wishing on a star
Kissing on a mattress and wearing your jacket
Sleeves falling past my hand
Just a few beautiful kids with no plan

And those were the reasons
And that was LA
We may have been stupid
But we were never untrue
And I just thought you were cool

And as the summer turns to fall
I won't even care that it all went wrong
I'll recall drinking wine from your backpack
And holding your hand in the back of a taxi
And the question you asked me
When summer fades and we go back to school
But I just let the answer flow
Kind of like the "O"s of smoke that you taught me to blow

'Cause it's you who taught me silence is sexy
And it's you who said it's kind to be cruel
Wherever you are, I hope that you knew
That I just thought you were cool


Title: It’s Not Something

Lyrics:
This isn't something
I can feel the headache coming
And you ain't saying nothing
No nothing, at least nothing new
You can touch me all you wanna
I ain't gonna try and stop ya
But before you tell your parents
There's something you should know

[Chorus]
It's not nothing, but it's not something
Yeah we had some fun, but it's not something
No it never was
The closer that we get
The more it seems to bore me
You should probably just ignore me
You have to notice I call at night
I don't mean to be cruel , I don't mean to be a bad guy
After this it is the last time
You must have known, you weren't my only girl

[Chorus 2x]


Title: I Wonder Who She’s Kissing Now

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Trung Ngo]
Girl I finally learned that you're just trouble
Grow nostalgic, but it's so ephemeral
And I remember that you're the cancer to my soul
I stood there, she gloated, she's happy, duly noted
No need to get everyone else involved
I'm waiting, she hates me, she says that karma's fading
No problem that a shaman couldn't solve
So take me up the mountain, bring me to the temple
Spill my guts into the sacrificial vessel
No pills or anaesthetic is allowed, the screaming is so loud
And I wonder who she's kissing now

[Chorus]
(Daa, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, daa, daaa, da) (Oooo)
I wonder who she's kissin' now
(Daa, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, daa, daaa, da) (Oooo)
I wonder who she's kissin'

[Verse 2: Trung Ngo]
If you're lonely come join the ceremony
No experience required come and dance around the fire
Take off your pretty dress, take off your painted flesh
Count to ten then we'll take care of all the rest
We'll get down on our knees, we'll worship at your feet
We'll rip your heart out just to show you that it beats
Then we'll throw it out cause that's what love is all about
And it's time that you found out
I wonder who she's kissin' now

[Chorus]
(Daa, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, daa, daaa, da) (Oooo)
I wonder who she's kissin' now
(Daa, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, daa, daaa, da) (Oooo)
I wonder who she's kissin' now
(Daa, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, daa, daaa, da) (Oooo)
I wonder who she's kissin' now
(Daa, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, daa, daaa, da) (Oooo)
I wonder who she's kissin'


Title: Jane’s Critique

Lyrics:
"Hi Brad, it's Mom! I just want to let you know I just finished listening to every song on your album, and you guys are extremely talented. I loved it! I loved all of it. My favorite one was 'The Artist', my favorite song. And I loved the way each song fades, at the end it fades into the next one. Very clever. So that's an official critique from your mother."


Title: Jayney And Johnny

Lyrics:
Johnny looked at Jayney and he knew that they'd be lovers
He had everything she wanted in the bank or under covers
He sat there and he watched her like some sleepy golden angel
He sat there and he watched her til he knew it wasn’t normal
He got out of the bed
And was careful not to wake her
He headed for the grocery store
For something he could make her
He had thought about some metaphor as he reached and grabbed a coffee
It was perfect
It was poignant
He immediately forgot it
And Johnny lit some stardust as he walked into his home
There was nothing inside moving, everything had turned to stone
No music
No Jayney
No word or explanation
No moral to the story, just some hair upon the pillow
♪
Jayney walked in to the farmland
Just like she always wanted
Everything was quiet
Everything seemed haunted
Jayney had a problem but the kind you’d never think of
Every guy who saw her fell hopelessly in love
It’s so tough to be the angel
In some poor suckers story
They all write her poetry but poetry’s so boring
And normally
She whispers to the millions of men who come
She conjures up a new excuse for each and every one
Floods
Tornadoes
Solemn vows of silence
Abstinence
Leprosy
Senseless bits of violence
Exhaustion
The economy
A million other reasons
But none of them can satisfy
Hearts get torn to pieces

♪

If you're ever left to wonder just where everything went wrong
Remember you're just a cameo in someone else's song
Alone in our bedrooms
Wandering through the fields
Everything seems haunted
And nothing is revealed

♪

Title: Jump the Turnstile

Lyrics:
[Intro]
Jump the turnstiles, never pay the toll
Jump the turnstiles, never pay the toll
Jump the turnstiles, never pay the toll
Doo-wah-diddy and bust in with the pre-roll
Jump the turnstiles, never pay the toll
Jump the turnstiles, never pay the toll
Jump the turnstiles, never pay the toll
Doo-wah-diddy and bust in with the pre-roll

[Verse 1]
If the southbound train keeps you away from me
And the stations are all the spaces in between
Found a ticket without a dollar in my jeans
You looked up to kiss me, but you were always taller in my dreams

[Verse 2]
Who really understands how the night connects to day?
When you can't even understand how it all connects today
All the working stiffs who had to work can say
I wonder why that little girl was crying on the train

[Chorus]
Found a friend
Found a home
Found a foe
All alone, so far away from home

[Refrain]
Jump the turnstiles, never pay the toll
Jump the turnstiles, never pay the toll
Jump the turnstiles, never pay the toll
Doo-wah-diddy and bust in with the pre-roll
Jump the turnstiles, never pay the toll
Jump the turnstiles, never pay the toll
Jump the turnstiles, never pay the toll
Doo-wah-diddy and bust in with the pre-roll

[Verse 3]
Everybody pretending that they don't see, that they don't know
That you're thinking of yesterday, but you're wearing tomorrow's clothes
It isn't fair when you pay the fare and he sends you back
You're left laying flat like a penny on the tracks

[Verse 4]
So hop the turnstile, baby, take the Q until you're sick
Stand on the platform, see the light through the wind
One second you're moving along and the next, you feel like shit
Never a free ride, never a yang without the yin

[Chorus]
Found a friend
Found a home
Found a foe
All alone, so far away from me

[Outro]
Jump the turnstiles, never pay the toll
Jump the turnstiles, never pay the toll
Jump the turnstiles, never pay the toll
Doo-wah-diddy and bust in with the pre-roll
Jump the turnstiles, never pay the toll
Jump the turnstiles, never pay the toll
Jump the turnstiles, never pay the toll
Doo-wah-diddy and bust in with the pre-roll


Title: Kamikazee

Lyrics:
[Sample from "Kamikaze" by MC Lyte]:
(I'm goin' kamikaze)
(Kamikaze)
(You ain't said nuttin' slick)

Maddie Acid leaving rappers flaccid
Gettin' illy with the nine-milly, landin' on my dashboard
Blastin' them out towards the future
Haters come at me 'cause I'm gettin' that ass like Kama Sutra
Pavin' a way to Hell's gate with a 12-gauge
I got on a ten-day wait from the sensei
So tell me if that makes sense
Because it's spilling enough blood to turn the motherfucking lake red

Fuck reputations
Work it, Joan Jett
These tone-deaf clones get blown to Stonehenge and back again
M80 on the track again
Packin' 210s, leave you empty like a juice cleanse
Making emcees, ephemera, et cetera
With wounds too huge for modern medicine
I bust slugs like a salt-shaker
And if you think you're in love, then I'm a motherfucking heart-breaker

Less talk, more gunplay
The broken clock unload the Glock
Like I was putting tokens in a slot
Bust the shots while I tell 'em "suck my cock"
Watch them rock gently in the tide by the fucking dock
I'm getting sloppy
Shooting at the sky
Killing all the angels, making baby Jesus cry
But why not? 'Cause when I grab the mic, it's white-hot
These laughing-gas rappers couldn't cut it like a bike lock
And have you ever seen a bitch so proud
To say shit so nasty I make myself blush
With the lust for life stick a knife to your guts
With no fuss but trust I bust rhymes like a cherry
Barely done before loadin' up another one
But all I got for haters is banana clips and bubble gum
Acid, watch it metastasize
Bullet through your heart call it "My Bloody Valentine"


Title: Keep Me Distracted

Lyrics:
I get variations by utilizing modifying devices. Look, why don't I just play it for you now, and then if i have to, explain it later, okay?
Sure

You can read along with me in your book. You will know it is time to turn the page when you hear the chimes ring like this

Oooooo

I’d rather be in the dark than in the know if I know where we’re goin’
There aren’t enough television shows or songs on radio
To keep me distracted
Keep me distracted
Keep me distracted
Keep me distracted

Oooooo

This is only the beginning


Title: Keep Me Distracted Part. II

Lyrics:
Woah woah
Woah woah
Woah woooah

Give me pills
Give me a drink
TV or a magazine
Too much is
Better than nothing
For Christ's sake
Just give me something to
To keep me distracted
Keep my mind off debt
Keep my mind occupied till it's nice and fried and there's nothing left

Open the vein
Plug me in
Entertainment information
Shut the blinds
Lock the door
How do you like it?
More more more
More answers than there's things to ask
History's just a thing of the past
The whole world's at my fingertips
And it all exists to
Keep me distracted
Keep me hanging on
As long as I get some satisfaction then
Who cares what's really going on?


Title: King of Echo Park

Lyrics:
As the sun sets on Sunset
It reflects against a can wet with condensation
His baby left
She’s going back to school again
And learning fifty ways to kill the conversation
'Cause if you can’t be good
You drink in the name of art
And as the sun sets on Sunset again
The stars come out so it don’t get dark
On the king of Echo Park

(The King of Echo Park)

Now she’s playing pool
At the Little Joy
Just a little drunk
She sees her little boy
And as they smoked outside
She wondered how long she’d have to wait
Until it wouldn’t be too soon
To take him back to her place
'Cause if you can’t go home (can't go home)
If you can't go home (can't go home)
With the one you love
You go home with someone
And it’s never too soon
And it’s never too late
'Cause when you’re royalty babe
You never have to work
And he’s the king of Echo Park

(The King of Echo Park)

Now he’s walking home
In the very same clothes
As the night before
Except you'd never know
And all the girls he’s bagged
They just can’t stay mad
They just wave their hands at no ordinary jerk

But who’s afraid of a little cliché
As he sipped iced tea in the palm tree shade
And as he looked around and everything was right
But as he closed his eyes he dreamt he was in New York
The King of Echo Park

(The King of Echo Park)


Title: Last year

Lyrics:
2 2400, Oxy's in my stomach, Liver hold the drank
2 Hundred in triple O's, Out of the bank
I hold the racks, Luh bitch I never change
Stealing yo shit, And I'm robbing yo gang
#136, Bitch I'm repping my gang
Why is you tripping ho? I ain't the same
I never change, I ain't the one to blame

Lil ho was tripping, She came for the fame
Girl you was different, I don't fuck with lames
You changed, You different, Girl you ain't the same
Miss who you were, When we started this flame

Don't feel the same, How you do that?
I let you leave mе without a kiss
Sit in the back of the club, With a pint of piss
I tear up into mysеlf know you wanted this

But you don't feel the same, I know you do that
Swear you see for yourself, Where you been at?
“Would you sneak out for me” , Bae you did that
You know I'll never block you, So fin that


Title: Laura

Lyrics:
Well I’ve been sitting on this couch
Feeling kinda bored and uninspired
Writing thinly veiled fiction for the soul
And feeling like a liar
I’ve been thinking about you, Laura
And thinking about the songs that you sing

And how you sang with such conviction
I almost forgot they weren’t for me
And I know you’re from another planet
And you’re crazy as a loon
But it’s too cold down here on Earth
To go up on the roof
But I’ll feel a little less alone
When I’m sitting in my room
Writing songs about you
Well I’ve been lying in this bed
Trying once again to find my muse
But if we’re only gonna die
Or worse get middle aged
Then what’s the use?

Still I remember what you said
How it’d be when you were dead and gone
And you are and here I am
Living proof that someone’s world had carried on
And I know you’re from another planet
And you’re crazy as a loon
But it’s too cold down here on Earth
To go up on the roof
But I’ll feel a little less alone
When I’m sitting in my room
Writing songs about you


Title: Legendary Lovers

Lyrics:
Baby baby when you make your escape
Make sure that you do it at the right time of day
In the middle of the night a moment of grace
As she hits every green light from here to LA

Your friends blew your cover
As sluts turn to mothers
And the legendary lovers
Get sick of one another
As dreams turn to daydreams
And punks learn to behave
Don’t worry about me babe
'Cause I’ll never change
I'll never change

[Here she comes! Here she comes! You'd better run!]

How many platitudes can you say
In the time that it takes for beauty to fade
Sedentary fireworks going bad
Like pouring out a bottle of gin on a drowning man
Shiny new fighter jets getting strafed on the deck
For every insolent B-boy who tripped and landed on his neck
Untameable stallions that got turned into glue
But don’t worry about me babe
'Cause I worry about you
Yes I do

[Here she comes! Here she comes! You'd better run!]


Title: Like We Planned

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
It's always midnight somewhere as someone contemplates her phone
And what they could possibly offer that would stop her from being alone
And if it's only coincidence that leads her to someone else
Too bad there's some things you just can't do by yourself

[Chorus]
But it's cool
I know the rules
The same ones that I learned in middle school
You keep it sweet and easy, exactly like she says
I don't know what she's crying for, she says it was only sex
Sometimes a girl forgets

[Verse 2]
It's always sad that somewhere, someone's feeling like a jerk
Just lying there in her underwear, and soon she's gonna go to work
Unless the walls collapse 'cause they were weakened by the rain
I drank my coffee slowly as she put on shoes and she walked away

[Chorus]
But hey it's cool
You know the rules
The same ones that you learned in middle school
You keep it sweet and easy, exactly like she says
I don't know what she's crying for, she says it was only sex
Sometimes a girl forgets

[Verse 3: Madison Acid]
Well it's 3 AM and the light was grey, the way it always is in paperbacks
I used to lay on my back and just stare at the ceiling
Trying to get a feeling that would come so easy
But love is a drug and a kiss is a hit
And I'm just standing on the corner, just wondering if
I could fall in love, well a girl could dream
Or you could die alone but... What does it all mean?

So I'll just kick these rocks and you just sing your song
And one day I'll be riding with the radio on
And I'll hear your voice but you'll be out on stage
Looking into the eyes of some girl who's name
You'll forget, but I bet she liked having you around
Just like I used to do when the rain came down
So loud, you could drown but you wouldn't get wet
I guess, some nights you just never forget


Title: Lines to a Different Play

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Here's another ending
Static on a page
Foregone conclusions
Just the faces aren't the same
Back in the apartment
She isn't what she seems
Words got blurted out
And fell like spit into my drink

[Chorus 1]
But if that's how it's got to go down
Then I'm gonna stay till you kick me out
And I know what feels good and what's not allowed
And there's plenty of heartache to go around

[Verse 2]
The part that's so confusing
It could happen like you say it should
Right down to the phrasing
Still it wouldn't do you any good
Back in the apartment
Dressed up like a stage
Unfamiliar actors saying lines to a different play

[Chorus 2]
But if she didn't want me then
Why'd she climb into my bed?
And I know some things you sing
You'd never say out loud
And there's plenty of heartache to go around

[Spoken sample]
I've been holding back
I've been giving you a break
Just so you get the hang of it
But now it's time to teach you a little respect, right
But it'll have to be next time


Title: Lizzy Come Back to Life

Lyrics:
I wrote a new song
It sounds like one of your songs
It doesn't really matter
I could write a hundred new ones
But I could never make them sound
The way that you do

Everyone dies
It ain't nothing new
On a gloomy afternoon
Lizzy come back to life

Topless in your headdress
Laying by the pool
Cigarette perched on your upper lip
Lizzy how'd you get so cool?

Out on the porch
Drinking beer, skipping school
Listenin' to Mambo Nassau
On a gloomy afternoon
Lizzy come back to life

I wanna go back to New York
And hang out with Patti Smith
And Richard Hell
I wanna dig the African rhythms
I wanna be there when you write
"Where Are the Gazelles?"

One 'cause you're beautiful
One for your soul
One for the memories
And the melodies I stole

From here on out
Everything's ruined
I can't listen to anything new
It all sounds dull coming after you
Lizzy come back to life

Come back to life
Come back to life
Come back to life
Come back to life


Title: Loneliness Can Be Demanding

Lyrics:
If your rhythm is the same how are you chanting
Try to wait for you but loneliness can be demanding

If your rhythm is the same how are you chanting
Try to wait for you but loneliness can be demanding

If your rhythm is the same how are you chanting
Try to wait for you but loneliness can be demanding


Title: Lonely Girls

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
From the moment that he looked at you and walked your way
Until the second when you knew there'd be no second date
Maybe your heart felt fine, it was your head that ached
But still you kissed him in the sprinklers but it felt like rain

[Chorus 1]
But so what
I guess you'll always be some lonely girl
And if you fall in love
You'll still be living in this lonely world

[Verse 2]
And from the moment when he said something and made you laugh
Until he was kind enough to let you know that it wouldn't last
But still you laid there in his arms after you'd swore you'd leave
Hair blowing from the ceiling fan but it felt like a breeze

[Chorus 2]
But so what
I guess you'll always be some lonely girl
And if you fall in love
You'll still be living in this lonely world
But so what
I guess you'll always be some lonely girl
And if you fall in love
You'll still be living in this lonely world


Title: Lo on the Hi-Way

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
My lover left at eight at night
The dark was heavier than life
Set the scene, but could've sworn that I was fine
You left the window wide open
Lying places I can't stand
Put my foot down, but you kept the upper hand

[Chorus]
Moving fast until it breaks
You left me weak and in a daze
Feelin' low on the highway

[Verse 2]
Cut me open, steal my clothes
Told me yes, but god only knows
Couldn't come, but that's just how the way life goes
Give me the boot, now I can't hear
Give me gifts, then to turn to steel
Made your bed, cooked all day, and I can't deal

[Pre-Chorus]
Felt like seconds but they were hours
A fallen rose is just a flower
Hand on my hip, it's just a waist
Felt so right, I can't erase
Feelin' low on the highway

[Outro]
I'm feelin' low on the highway
I'm feelin' low on the highway
I’m feelin' low on the highway


Title: Loud and Clear

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
And when you left you said it’s ‘cause I never listened
At least that's what I think you said
But that’s not really accurate now is it?
And if it is, does it even make a difference?
If I don’t listen all the time then I might miss it
It’s more than just a habit
And I don’t get how you just casually dismiss it
And separate signal from the static

[Chorus]
I turn my stereo on so I don’t have to hear
I turn the volume way up until it hurts my ears
But it sounds exactly as I feared
The silence is loud and clear

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I wish that I could stop you from talking
Sometimes I wish that everyone would just shut up
But when it comes down to keeping me distracted
Too much is never enough
Look at us now, aren’t we fabulously clever?
Don’t we all just have such witty things to say?
Have you noticed how it all just blends together
And melts away?

[Chorus]
I turn my stereo on so I don’t have to hear
I turn the volume way up until it hurts my ears
But it sounds exactly as I feared
The silence is loud and clear


Title: Louise

Lyrics:
[Sample from Laura Nyro being interviewed by William Kloman for Critique, 1969]
“And, uh, there’s a song there, that’s, that’s coming from, you know, from inside me.”

[Verse 1]
Louise, she just wasn't thinking
When she climbed into his bed
She only wanted to lie beside him
To hell with his best friend
She woke him up and she whispered
But the answer wasn't good:
"Whatever made you think I would ever love you
Even if I could?"

[Chorus]
Louise (Louise)
You can't be anybody's friend
Louise (Louise)
I'll love you 'til I'm dead
Louise (Louise)
Not even if she likes the way you dance
Louise never heard about puppy love
'Cause they don't know that term in France

[Verse 2]
She came from across the country
Just to stare into her phone
She came to the same apartment
She only wanted to be left alone
And she could catch anybody's attention
But it never won her friends
Love could kick you out on the streets
But it never paid your rent

[Chorus]
Louise (Louise)
You can't be anybody's friend
Louise (Louise)
I'll love you 'til I'm dead
Louise (Louise)
Not even if she likes the way you dance
Louise never heard about puppy love
'Cause they don't know that term in France


Title: Love Is a Nuclear War (Pre-TV Girl)

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
San Francisco is too far, I know
Your postcards never made it home
You kept moving to stay alive
Said that if you didn't run you would rust and die
Keep them in line
And they'll pick you up
And one by one to the delivery truck
Where you'll be picked up from a tree
And there your color shifts from red to green

[Chorus]
I hide in my robe just to lighten my love
I stare at the moon at night so I don't feel so alone
Your love is like a nuclear war
Each day gets worse than the day before

[Verse 2]
Someone still loves you, or so you hope
You don't know what to think
So you do as your told
The artsy kids arе dropping out of school
Cause struggling arts got no time to lose
Static at night,just drеss them up as dreams
Take a closer look to see things aren't as they seem
What the television says is probably right
The grass is greener on the other

[Chorus]
I hide in my robe just to lighten my love
I stare at the moon at night so I don't feel so alone
Your love is like a nuclear war
Each day gets worse than the day before

[Outro]
I hide in my robe just to lighten my love
I stare at the moon at night so I don't feel so alone
Your love is like a nuclear war
Each day gets worse than the day before


Title: Lovers Rock

Lyrics:
[Produced by TV Girl]
[Verse 1: Brad Petering]
Are you sick of me?
Would you like to be?
I'm tryin' to tell you somethin'
Somethin' that I already said
You like a pretty boy
With a pretty voice
Who is tryin' to sell you somethin'
Somethin' that you already have

[Chorus: Brad Petering, Brad Petering & Faith Harding]
But if you're too drunk to drive, and the music is right
She might let you stay, but just for the night
And if she grabs for your hand, and drags you along
She might want a kiss before the end of the song
Because love can burn like a cigarette
And leave you with nothin'
And leave you with nothin'

[Verse 2: Brad Petering]
While the others talked
We were listenin' to Lover's Rock
In her bedroom
In her bedroom
And if you start to kiss
And the record skips
Flip it over
And sit a little closer

[Chorus: Brad Petering, Brad Petering & Faith Harding]
But if you're too drunk to drive, and the music is right
She might let you stay, but just for the night
And if she grabs for your hand, and drags you along
She might want a kiss before the end of the song
Because love can burn like a cigarette
And leave you with nothin'
And leave you with nothin'
[Dialogue: Lafitte & Constance]
Now, how many men have you kissed?
Very few. 
But you offered me a kiss. Why?
Such a foolish reason, I'm afraid. I just wanted to kiss you. 

[Bridge: Brad Petering]
Du-du, du-du-du-du, du-du
Du-du, du-du-du-du, du-du
Du-du, du-du-du-du, du-du
Du-du, du-du-du-du, du-du

[Outro: Brad Petering, Faith Harding, Brad Petering & Faith Harding]
Because love can burn like a cigarette (Du-du, du-du-du-du, du-du)
(Du-du, du-du-du-du, du-du)
And leave you with nothin' (Du-du, du-du-du-du, du-du)
And leave you with nothin' (Du)


Title: Loving Machine

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Here she comes walking down the street
Maddie Klein and her fabulous loving machine
In the place where I used to be
He almost looks like a human being
And here she comes walking down the street
Maddie Klein sure loves her little loving machine
Sometimes he holds her hand too tight
Ooh, but that's all right

[Chorus]
'Cause he'll never leave
No, he'll never leave
But will he ever pull her hair like she likes?
No, but that's all right
Maddie Klein and her fabulous loving machine

[Verse 2]
There they go, walking up the street
She'll take him home, shut him down, and she'll go to sleep
And that's just the way that it's got to be
She can't get him wet, or he'll overheat
And who really cares about a little rust
If Maddie Klein's got herself a little boy she can trust?
Sometimes she misses the flesh and bone
But they only wanna screw her, and leave her alone

[Chorus 2]
But he'll never leave
No, he'll never leave
Will he ever smack her ass like she likes?
Will he ever make her laugh late at night?
No, but he'll never leave
When he gets obsolete
She can always just throw him away
Get a new one, but that's okay
She'll love him the same
As her fabulous loving machine

[Flute Outro]


Title: Low Signal

Lyrics:
Sunburnt treads
Low signal in my head
"Son", they said
"It's easy to forget"
And I don't-

Found a reason to believe
There's a fault in this machine
Memory is on repeat
What does it mean
Memory is on repeat
What does it mean?
I [?] order and out of place
This roof won't keep this home from blowing away

Found a reason to believe
There's a fault in this machine
Memory is on repeat
What does it mean?


Title: Maddie in Heaven

Lyrics:
Waking up in the morning gotta thank God
I don’t know but this place seems kinda odd
No meters on the block and no blogs
Hyping up corny bitches with no clothes on
No labels with bad taste
Signing wack rappers just to sell a little ad space
Peruse the reviews from my mixtape
Everyone agrees Maddie rocks and her shit’s great
I tell you it’s a beautiful world
When they say you rap good not just for a girl
And right then I got a text from Brad
He was working on a beat and it wasn’t half bad
And so I hit the streets
Felt something in the pocket of my ripped-up jeans
A $20 bill with my face on it
Said "in Maddie we trust, bitch" now go and put some bass on it

[Sample from "Poor Georgie" by MC Lyte]
(Like an angel from the heaven above)
(From the heaven above)
(From the heaven above)

And so I head into the caffeine spot
And grab an iced Americano with the extra shot
I found some cigs
Like half a pack
So I lit a couple up and I wrote these raps
I went to the cute barista
I said “I’m Maddie and it’s nice to meet ya
And maybe when you get off we can catch a feature, or go to your crib and just smoke some reefer"
We did like I said so
We got some milkshakes but we drank them in her bed though
She plucked a cherry off the top
She put em in her mouth and tied the shit into a knot
We made out for a while
Watched X-Files on mute while we did the deed
That’s the script y’all fill in the scene
Maddie on the mic and it’s good to be queen

I cruised to Brad’s and everything was fine
He had the beats I had the rhymes
I had the kief he had the wine
He passed me the mic
So I said check two let me kick it one time
We did the song in a single take
We knew it was a hit so we took a break
But the booze got me juiced up
Started fucking around
Freestylin’ like we used to
But the cypher kept going forever
I never choked I always thought of something clever
We rocked ‘till the cops came
And when they got out the car
The beat hit ‘em like a shockwave
And they just couldn’t resist
Grabbed their microphones and started to riff
And for one fly second everything was right
And that was called heaven
Just a girl and her mic

[Sample from "Let's Dance" by Sweet Tee]
(I'm in the midst of a rappin' blitz)
(Of a rappin' blitz)
(Of a rappin' blitz)
(I'm in the midst of a rappin' blitz)
(And you ain't never heard a girl rock the mic like this)


Title: Make it Pop

Lyrics:
[Sample from the movie "Ms .45"]:
"Every day, on every street...in every city...women are insulted. Abused. Bred."

[Samples from "Mama Said Knock You Out" by LL Cool J, A.W.O.L. by RBX]

I can rock a beat
Plus rock around
But I think it's time to show my full range
Pull out the Glock
Hit him at close range
Knock their socks off, and call me fucking close-change
'Cause I'm sick of these cat-calls
I got a gat-ful
It's not a metaphor if it's actual
One on my ankle, one on my belt
And I like 'em so much I'ma shoot myself
'Cause mace is great, a knife is fine
But I like the peace of mind that I get with my nine
M80, the queen of thieves
Not talking bamboo when she shoots some leaves
And this is going out to every skeeve
On every street that made me ill at ease
They want sex, but I've got what they need
Cock back, aim it at their jockstrap and squeeze

(Make it pop)
Make it pop
(Make it pop)

One night I was all alone just walking
Minding my own, but then this dude kept stalking
And every girl knows just what I'm talking
I could call the cops but I've got another option
I said, "I bet you're in the mood for love,"
"Let's go around the corner and have some fun."
He just grinned and he grabbed his prick
And said "What's up, bitch, now suck my dick."
But I said "not yet" 'cause I practice safe sex
Not talking 'bout pills, not talkin' latex
I got this method that's totally effective
My weapon, a nine-millimeter Smith & Wesson
And this is my idea of dome
Shove it in his mouth, make him taste the chrome
Baby, baby keep going
'Til you hit the spot
And make it pop

(Make it pop)
Make it pop
(Make it pop)

[Sample from the movie "A Gun for Jennifer"]:
"We hear that was quite a shot you made. You're a regular Dirty Harry. How'd you get to be so good with a gun?"
"Well I've been around guns my whole life. My daddy was a Green Beret. Good old Dad. Wanted to make sure I learned how to shoot properly. Even if I was just a girl."


Title: Meek Mill x TV Girl

Lyrics:
[Intro: Meek Mill]
Yeah, uh, look

[Verse: Meek Mill]
The summer nights can even turn cold
In the streets of Philly, where niggas don't even get to turn old
My heart pumping 'till it turn gold
You niggas stuck in neutral, I'm ridin' like, "Fuck it, it's a long road"
Shit I'm the one, I'm like the lost soul
In the middle of heaven and hell
See nigga, only God knows
When your time gon' come
And your eyes roll straight to the back
Now you seeing all black
That MAC go lean and that nine go crack
This that murder-murder music to rewind you back
Put that Ruger all up to you, watch your mind go splat
All over the wall, nigga, all over that raw
It's the same ol' Meek, still the same OG
Got that crack music, listеn, let your brain OD
I be playing low key
Mе and one of my niggas
Riding through the city, plotting on some of the niggas
That be thinking they gon' get me
I'ma run to you niggas
And that's a couple dead bodies for a couple of niggas
G'yeah, monster, sitting like a mobster
Revolver on my lap, barrel full of Black Talons
I lick it at your squadron
Roll up, like, "Hold up"
Start spitting while I'm driving
Peel off then roll up, you niggas better slow up
Before you bang the fuck out
I aim, let it flame, blow your brains all the fuck out
All over your shirt, since a youngin' I was buck wild
All up in the dirt, ma screaming, "Get the fuck out!"
North where I was raised at, South Philly, I played that
Wherever I'm around I hold it down like a wave cap
Yeah, my niggas stay strapped
Blaze and I'ma blaze back
All over that yolk, get your motherfuckin' egg cracked
North side of Berks Streeta and Southside of Eight Balla
Posted by the green gate, cops come, we scrape on 'em
Niggas dropping tapes on 'em
Tryna get us locked down
Snitchin' to the district
That's enough to get ya chopped down
That nine parabellum, fuck around and get a nigga momma cerebellum
They ain't riding, man they tellin'
I be sliding with a seven, all titanium
Big boy sound, jump around when I'm flamin' him
Me, I play my role, gettin' hoes like I'm Chamberlain
Same one you kissed, same one that give me cranium
Every time I touch a gun, all I hear is, "Damien"
Tryna pipe me up to rock a nigga like-

[Inaudible talking]


Title: Melanie

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Melanie
Looks a lot like Stephanie
She looks a lot like Jane
Who looks a lot like Amy
Who looks a lot like Emily
Melanie
I wonder what she's tellin' me now
How she's twenty grand in debt, or someone famous that she slept with
Or how everybody loves her, what drugs she doesn't take, but
I don't really know why I talk to her
I guess 'cause she has big fat eyes
Swallows awkward silences so you don't even have to try
Besides, she never really talks to you
She's always looking 'cross the room
At someone who just came inside

[Chorus]
Melanie
How the hell'd she get to be the way that she is?
How could anyone ever say they really loved her?
I feel sorry for her unborn kids

[Verse 2]
Melanie
She looks so heavenly, she's nature's great creation
She better be
She has no female friends, and she's not much for conversation

Melanie
Are you really as mentally as dead as you seem?
I wanna rip you apart at the seams
Just to know what's inside but I'm afraid of what I'll see
I know I know I know I know she'll be in the front row at the show
She used to date someone in the band
She drinks until she can hardly stand
Some sucker holds her hand
While she throws up in the van

[Chorus]
Melanie
How the hell'd she get to be the way that she is?
How could anyone ever say they really loved her?
I feel sorry for her unborn kids
Melanie
Looks a lot like Bethany
She looks a lot like Tiffany
She looks a lot like Natalie

[Bridge]
They ought to put you away
'Cause you're too good-looking
They ought to put you in chains
Before you get your hooks in
They ought to smack you around, they ought to cut off your tongue
They ought to shave off your eyebrows, send you to a nun
They ought to get you a job 'cause you have too much fun
They ought to carve you in marble, sell you by the ton, oh

[Outro]
Melanie
Melanie
Melanie
Melanie


Title: Mirror Mirror

Lyrics:
Mirror mirror on the wall
Tell me is it all my fault
Don’t you look at me like that
I’m not so bad

It’s exactly like you told me
If I were you then you’d be lonely
If you were me then you’d kiss and hold me
‘Cause I’m so sad

And I’m glad that everything’s dissolving
The sun’s down and the earth’s revolving
Everything looks so expensive
You must think I’m so pretentious
They all have the best intentions
That’s the devil’s best invention
Take the pill, get the reference
They’ll get us all arrested

Locked away, throw away the key
Now we get to eat for free
Call your parents, no reply
Stick a needle in my eye
If I die before I wake
Make sure all the lines are straight
And all the words stay in their place
All I ever wanted was a little taste of sugar

Ooh, honey, honey
Let’s get together
We can make a lot of money

Sit there sulking on the stairs
Brown eyes and silky hair
Breathing in the filthy air
Where it comes from, no one cares

Where it goes, up your nose
Past your tongue and down your throat
Where it lands, plant a rose
Dig it up before it grows

And if you can’t afford new clothes
Rip apart your pantyhose
Cut your pants and strike a pose
With everything that can be exposed

Hide your eyes, talk real slow
In the famous sultry tone
Get the dreamboat all alone
It won’t be hard to drag him home

Is he the one who loves you so?
Do you really wanna know?
It’s in his kiss, that’s where it is
It’s in his hips that’s where it is
And if you’re sure that this is it
Go ahead and slit your wrists
Because ever since we were little kids
All I ever wanted was a little bit of sugar

Ooh, honey, honey
Let’s get together
We can make a lot of money


Title: Misery

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Misery is funny
‘Cause misery is nothing
And nothing is funnier than nothing
Yeah

And misery is hungry
The souls are what it eats
It devours all your insides and leaves you
Lighter than the breeze

And misery is money
As money ties you down
But there's nowhere I'd rather be
When it starts to smack me around

[Chorus]
‘Cause I like it
I like it
Stop what you’re doin’ to me
I like it

[Verse 2]
And misery loves company
And I love misery
We’ll take out a second mortgage
We’ll start a little family
And everyone will be miserable
And everyone will sing together
I know there's something wrong with me
But I hope I never get better

[Chorus]
‘Cause I like it
I like it
Stop what you’re doin’ to me
I like it

[Outro]
I like it


Title: Museum (Pre-TV Girl)

Lyrics:
I was born in this museum
Spiderwebs all over the ceiling
I was born without feelings
People watching can be revealing
Dinosaurs didn't start the war (Woah oh, woah oh)
Didn't know what they were fighting for (Woah oh, woah oh)

Too dead (Too dead)
To die (To die)
Goodbye (Goodbye)
Blue eyes (Blue eyes)
Not me (Not me)
Not I (Not I)
Too drunk (Too drunk)
To drive (To drive)
You want money, it's buried under the lawn
Talk to Murray, he's the man that you want

Oh darling, everyone knows
Because sеcrets don't go untold
And I heard it, (And he hеard it)
And I heard it through the telephone

I was thrown into the light
Fit to be the human sacrifice
I was thrown into this room
Information, population, booth [?]
Didn't know (Didn't know)
At the time (At the time)
Teardrops (Teardrops)
In her eyes (In her eyes)
I thought (I thought)
Why not (Why not)
I bought (I bought)
A lot (A lot)

Oh darling, everyone knows
Because secrets don't go untold
And I heard it, (And he heard it)
And I heard it through the telephone


Title: My Girlfriend

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
My girlfriend gets so depressed
She never leaves the house
She doesn't even get dressed
My girlfriend always leaves a mess
She says she's gonna clean
But she always forgets
My girlfriend is there when I get home
Watching movies on TV
Or talking on the phone
Sometimes I want to leave, but I got nowhere to go
But hey, nobody's perfect
No one wants to be alone

[Refrain]

[Verse 2]
My girlfriend is so unimpressed
By everything I say
You can see it in her face
I don't say much, I just hope and pray
There's been some big mistake
And buy her flowers just in case
And I don't mind it when she goes out with her friends
They drop her off drunk
And I take her up to bed
She says 'I'm sorry' and I kiss her on the head
And everything is fine
Until the morning comes again

[Refrain]

[Bridge]
I remember when we were in high school
I took her to the dance
We snuck out to the bleachers
And I thought that I might take a chance
But it never does any long-term good
To go thinking about the past
God damn this wandering mind of mine
That can't be happy with what it has

But I'm not mad
And sometimes we still laugh
And when she's just getting up
And the sun hits her right
She doesn't even look half bad

[Refrain]

[Outro]
My girlfriend gets so depressed
She never leaves the house
She doesn't even get dressed
My girlfriend is so unimpressed
By everything I say
You can see it in her face


Title: Natalie Wood

Lyrics:
[Voiceover]
(We have a very absorbing story of a girl who was forced into a game of terror. In which the dice were loaded with--)

No one knew if her face was black and blue when she hit the water
But it was when they dragged her out
Are the rumors true, did you see those empty bottles
They had come to see what the fuss was all about

And every cop in town was her audience that night
They had come from all around, they heard she was famous
But you'd never know, except her hair was perfect
And everyone kind of felt like movie stars and they went home so impressed

By Natalie Wood
(Natalie Wood)
I'll see you in my dreams
Natalie Wood
(Natalie Wood)
Marlon Brando, and Steve McQueen

Cut to the scene, she turned seventeen
And do you still believe everything that your mother told ya?
'Cause when you're born into this life, reciting lines is a waste of time
Just go in there and close the door behind ya
And there's a world of difference between acing the audition
And doing whatever it takes to win the part
And all those other girls, well they just had to listen
They knew it took more than kissing if you want to break somebody's heart

Like Natalie Wood
(Natalie Wood)
I'll see you in my dreams
Natalie Wood
(Natalie Wood)
Marlon Brando, and Steve McQueen
Doesn't matter who they're pointing at
'Cause the cameras always shine on you
Fifteen when you cut your pigtail
Washed up at twenty-two

Like Natalie Wood
I'll see you in my dreams
Natalie Wood
Dennis Hopper, James Dean

Natalie Wood
(Natalie Wood)
I'll see you in my dreams
Natalie Wood
Marlon Brando, and Steve McQueen


Title: Not Allowed

Lyrics:
[Intro: Yeastie Girlz]
Now you suck
We wanna talk about sex but we're not allowed
Well, you may not like it but you better learn how 'cause it's your turn now
You're wasting your tongue with lame excuses and lies
Now, what's on your nasty old mind?

[Verse 1: TV Girl]
So how should I begin this?
I guess it started when you were with him
And how he never even took you out to dance
But did he fuck with any rhythm?
But now he's playing with your head
But did he ever make you cum?
Did he ever make you cry?
Do the wires in your mind get sewn together?
Rubbed and severed by the heat
You don't know how long I could stare into your picture
And wish that it was me
I guess it's different 'cause you love him
But I've got an interactive
Sick and twisted imagination
And that's gotta count for something

[Chorus: Yeastie Girlz]
We wanna talk about sex but we're not allowed
Well, you may not like it but you'd better learn how 'cause it's your turn now
You're wasting your tongue with lame excuses and lies
Get your face between my thighs

[Verse 2: TV Girl]
I dreamt I was standing in your doorstep
Licking sweat off of your forehead
With your finger in my mouth
And the sound when leather jackets hit the ground
You should hear when you're not around
When it's just us horny poets
Who can't wait to write it down
And swear we were only being honest
Do you like these little sonnets?
'Cause I wrote them just for you
But how quickly they turn sour
So be careful who you screw
And never call
And I'm starting to suspect
You don't intend to do anything you say at all

[Chorus: Yeastie Girlz]
We wanna talk about sex but we're not allowed
Well, you may not like it but you'd better learn how 'cause it's your turn now
You're wasting your tongue with lame excuses and lies
Now, what's on your nasty old mind?

[Outro: Yeastie Girlz]
All by yourself, sittin' alone
I hope we're still friends, yeah, I hope you don't mind
All by yourself, sittin' alone
I hope we're still friends, yeah, I hope you don't mind
All by yourself, sittin' alone
I hope we're still friends, yeah, I hope you don't mind
All by yourself, sittin' alone
I hope we're still friends, yeah, I hope you don't mind
All by yourself, sittin' alone
I hope we're still friends, yeah, I hope you don't mind
All by yourself, sittin' alone
I hope we're still friends, yeah, I hope you don't mind
All by yourself, sittin' alone
I hope we're still friends, yeah, I hope you don't mind
All by yourself, sittin' alone
I hope we're still friends, yeah, I hope you don't mind


Title: One of These Mornings

Lyrics:
[Chorus]
One of these mornings
It won't be long
You're gonna look for me, child
And I'll be gone
One of these mornings
It won't be long
You're gonna look for me, child
And I'll be gone
[Verse 1]
What does it mean?
Ooh, tell me what does it mean?
To live free
Anywhere
When you're stuck in this body
When you're stuck in this house
You're stuck in your ways
A bird in a cage
Stuck with it's brain
Making the same mistakes
But that's okay
'Cause you can change your hair and change your life
You change your mouth, your nose, your eye, your skin
You can change into a twenty year old deadbeat
And drop acid in a warehouse somewhere and abandon the kid but

[Pre-Chorus]
I heard it's said but we never told
You see it in their eyes and you know it's true
We could stand here in the same painted room
But our eyes would be different hues

[Chorus]
One of these mornings
It won't be long
You're gonna look for me, child
And I'll be gone
One of these mornings
It won't be long
You're gonna look for me, child
And I'll be gone
[Verse 2]
I meant to tell ya
Thought that I told ya
But heaven is a boardroom
It's a place on earth between saved and the drawn
With immaculate reception
And you could tell me again how you preferred sensitive men
But how you could make an exception
And how pagans and virgins and whores down on the floor
On all fours, eyes glazed over in genuflection
But what if you're just too fucked up to ascend
And what if your halo is bent so far that it touches your head and sharpens the edge?
And what if the word on high was passed down, written on a stone and crossed out in pen but

[Pre-Chorus]
I heard it's sad though I didn't hear
I'm sorry, kid, I just can't forget
Can't wash your sins when they're caked on so thick
If you did, there'd be nothing left

[Chorus]
One of these mornings
It won't be long
You're gonna look for me, child
And I'll be gone
One of these mornings
It won't be long
You're gonna look for me, child
And I'll be gone


Title: On Land

Lyrics:
Listen as I integrate these words with chords I've made from fingers so warm
Been torn from yours

I time traveled and unraveled the mysteries of the universe
And now I know
Now I know what not to do with you
Open up and jump, the longer you wait the longer you'll hesitate
And as for me I'll let gravity take its course, 'cause I've fallen already

What were those words you said as you were leaving?
Were they recycled from the mouths of dead poets? I'll pretend I didn't notice
Let's depend on springtime to cure our broken hearts
And in the mean time, you and I should just
Manage on, my soul unraveling
Manage on, my soul unraveling
Not uncommon, we're just matter we
I'm chemically inclined to be

Manage on, my soul unraveling
Manage on, my soul unraveling
Not uncommon, we're just matter we
I'm chemically inclined to be


Title: On the Fence

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Prepare the words for the audition
Bottle of words inside the conversation
Lips pressed together and you sat there waiting
For something clever, something worth saying

You taped the role and I played the part
You dealt the hand; now I’ve played my cards
But this isn’t what you really wanted
The leftovers of a heart so haunted
A heart so haunted
A heart so haunted

[Verse 2]
Would it make a difference if it made any sense?
Fall deeper by the minute
Are you playing on the fence?

Would it make a difference if it made any sense?
Fall deeper by the minute
Are you playing on the fence?

Would it make a difference if it made any sense?
Fall deeper by the minute
Are you playing on the fence?

Would it make a difference if it made any sense?
Fall deeper by the minute
Are you playing on the fence?


Title: Ordinary Day

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Skinny little skater boys
They only wanna play
They jump around all day
But you can never make them stay
Pretty girls in overalls
Are everywhere these days
Talking up their game
But they only go away

[Chorus]
All of this to say
It's just an ordinary day

[Verse 2]
Little birds might sing to you
As if they were your friend
But don't be fooled again
They only want what's in your hand
Couple with the silver hair
Kissing on the bench
Falling in love again
Guess it never ends

[Chorus]
All of this to say
It's just an ordinary day
All the world to stay
On an ordinary day


Title: Pantyhose

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Boys marching to war
To certain defeat
They were younger than me
Guns poke through the trees
Death on a whim
They were aiming at him

[Hook 1]
And when the bullets came he didn't duck
He wrapped her pantyhose around his neck
And he could feel their magic working
Keeping him from harm
Away to some place mystical and warm
His lucky charm

[Verse 2]
He got caught
No cover at all
He'd breathe in her scent
Not even a scratch
He didn't die
When he stepped on a mine
They were violet and soft
It didn't go off

[Hook 2]
And when her letter came
He didn't cry
He wrapped her pantyhose around his eyes
And he could feel their magic working
Keeping him from harm
Even though she didn't love him anymore
You can't kill a lucky charm


Title: Pocketful of Posies

Lyrics:
[Sample from "Pocket Full of Posies" by Ó]
(Pocket full of posies, fall down next to)
(Pocket full of posies, fall down next to)

Hey boy, has it really been so long?
Just wanted to talk and ask how you're doing
Not what went wrong, or who you're screwing
Just to kick it for a second kinda like we used to
Don't know about you but I think it's kinda strange
How we would stay inside and just hang for days
And everything else would just fade away
How we'd our change our names and move to Spain
Yeah, if we only had the guts
Instead we just laughed and smoked and stuff
And after all we did, and all we said
Now we have to act like we're almost friends
And like you're not a part of me
So pardon me if I kept watering the flowers that you left behind
When you left and you left me only
A pocketful of posies

(Pocket full of posies, fall down next to)
Pocketful of posies
(Pocket full of posies, fall down next to)
Pocketful of posies
(Pocket full of posies, fall down next to)
Pocketful of posies
(Pocket full of posies, fall down next to)

And whoever said there's one true love
Then I guess that I'll always love you
But people just up and leave
And love grows cold like a cup of tea
But it still tastes good on ice
So don't think twice, it's all right like the singer once said
The one you used to play while we laid in bed
And now I just stand and I'm playing pretend
But who's gonna drive you home
Who's gonna write you poems
Who's gonna crack my tones
Who's gonna make you laugh
With these silly-ass rhymes that you thought were dumb
And I was having fun just for a minute
Making love because we were in it
Making up another ending
I said it, I meant it
I guess it's only
A pocketful of posies

(Pocket full of posies, fall down next to)
Pocketful of posies
(Pocket full of posies, fall down next to)
Pocketful of posies
(Pocket full of posies, fall down next to)
Pocketful of posies
(Pocket full of posies, fall down next to)

[Sample from "Steady Fucking" by MC Lyte]
(Ring around the rosie, pocketful of posie)


Title: Pretty Boy

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
If it were up to me
I’d turn you into a stone
And turn the lights down low for effect
And I’d steal your cigarettes and I'd be
Softer than I am through cigarette smoke
And if anybody asks, I'll say I did it as a joke, so
But how about his loneliness, he gets it from his mom
100 dollars for his haircut, but a smile from God
And when he touches you you’ll wonder how he keeps his hands so soft
He got some money from his grandma
Guess he’ll never have a job

[Chorus 1]
Oh pretty boy (pretty boy)
Don’t speak (don't speak)
You pretty boys (pretty boys)
Are only good for one thing (for one thing)

[Verse 2]
But anyways
That isn’t even what I meant to say
I meant to sing a song to you to make you fall asleep
And I wouldn’t have to talk to you and you wouldn’t talk to me
But I could lay on top of you and soak in all your heat
Don’t let them catch you crying, boy, if it didn’t really hurt
She took a drink to jog her memory but it didn’t really work
She meant to sing a song but couldn’t memorize the words
She only knew the chorus she had to mumble through the verse

[Chorus 2]
Oh pretty boy (pretty boy)
Don’t think (don't think)
You pretty boys (pretty boys)
Are only good for one thing (for one thing)


Title: Pretty Girls Cry

Lyrics:
I'm sorry Ashley
That you saw it through the window
That you saw it through the window when you were standing on the grass
Of the frat that we had went to
And we didn't leave together
'Cuz upstairs it was Jacquelyn, and well she had other plans
I'm sorry Ashley
But what can be said
Cuz I know just one thing that I like better than sex

And maybe I was dropped on my head when I was a child

Cuz i like making pretty girls cry
Like making pretty girls cry

And I'm sorry Jacquelyn
I really tried to make it happen
I really tried to move my fingers in a way that I thought you'd like
And I don't need to tell ya I didn't know what I was doin'
Have mercy on a virgin, he's only seventeen
I'm sorry Jacquelyn but what can be done
Cuz' screwing up a good thing was always too much fun

But I can get off on your eyes when you kiss me goodbye
Cuz' I like making pretty girls cry
Like making pretty girls cry

And I don't know why
I don't know why
I don't know why
I don't know why
I
Like makin' pretty girls cry
Like makin' pretty girls cry
(Instrumental)

Title: Safeword

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
You should know, you should know, you should know
You should know by now
What they say, what they say, what they say
When you're not around
And a little girl should be careful
But who's gonna make her?
When those boys start playing too rough
Well, who's gonna save her? Ooh

[Chorus]
Remember your safeword
Remember your safeword
Remember your safeword, ooh
Remember your safeword

[Verse 2]
And it's a dull, dull world
Where you need to manufacture some action
She'll take you home, tie you up, and slap ya
Without even askin'
And all the clamps and whips in Los Angeles
Couldn't faze her
So if you really wanna see her in pain
Just wait until later, ooh

[Chorus]
Remember your safeword
Remember your safeword
Remember your safeword, ooh
Remember your safeword

[Verse 3]
And if everything could come to a stop
Just from something she says
I thought the whole point was you were living on the edge
So when those sounds start to drift down the halls
And start to freak out the neighbors
Remember that it's good, clean, fun
Just wholesome delinquent behavior, ooh

[Chorus]
Remember your safeword
Remember your safeword
Remember your safeword, ooh
Remember your safeword
Remember your safeword
Remember your safeword


Title: Sarah (Meet Me in the Sauna)

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
So alone in the midday sun and I
Love it when she tells me to walk not run, oh
Sarah you're the lifeguard of my dreams
But you never notice 'cause I'm seventeen, oh

[Chorus]
Come on, take your eyes off the pool
Come on over, explain the rules
I know you're working
Baby don't you wanna
Come on Sarah
Meet me in the sauna

(Come on Sarah)

[Verse 2]
I love the sunscreen on your nose
And your goofy straw hat and your sun-burned toes
Give me a chance, I'll do whatever it takes
I think it's time you called a ten-minute break, so

[Chorus]
Blow the whistle, tell the kids not to dive
Throw me something just to save my life
I know how to swim
But baby I'm not gonna
Come on Sarah
Meet me in the sauna

(Come on Sarah)

[Verse 3]
I even heard you play the bass guitar
Sarah do you even know how pretty you are?
Take off your shades, look me in the eye
And tell me that you're happy with those college guys, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Come on Sarah, don't be like that
We can sneak away while my dad swims laps
I know you're working
I know you wanna
Come on Sarah
Meet me in the sauna

[Chorus]
Come on, take your eyes off the pool
Come on over, explain the rules
I know you're working
Baby don't you wanna
Come on Sarah
Meet me in the sauna

[Outro]
Come on Sarah
Meet me in the sauna
Come on Sarah
Meet me in the sauna


Title: Shame

Lyrics:
[Intro]
It's a shame
It's a shame
It's a shame
It's a shame

[Verse 1]
Wherever you go, I'll go with ya, and
Whatever you smoke, I'll smoke with ya
Whenever you pose, I will take your picture
Even though I just wish I was in it, just have something to remember
We lit our cigarettes with studied thoughtfulness, and
Dreamed of high consciences but really one of the opposite, and
Who unscrewed the bottle and poured booze onto the flame?
Who gives a damn about all the consequence?
I just wanted to know your name

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a shame (It's a shame)
But all in love is fair, and
It's a shame (It's a shame)
It's pain we have to bear
And it's a shame (It's a shame)
When you got no one left to blame and you say
"Don't go," But they're are already there
It's a shame (It's a shame)
It's just a shame (It's a shame, It's a shame)
It's a shame (It's a shame)
It's just a shame (It's a shame, It's a shame)
It's a crying shame

[Verse 2]
Whenever you pay, I'll pay for ya, and I
Wherever you lay, I'll lay on ya, and I
Whatever you say, I will do the octave
Even though you don't care much for harmonies
I just wanted to give you the option
We drink and we womanize, we
Fuck and we fetishize, we
Get clean and testify, we
Relapse and we justify, but
So many to eulogize when no one calls the press
And I guess our love it just crystallizes and some stays in the air

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's a shame (It's a shame)
We just can't get along, and
It's a shame (It's a shame)
When things just turn out wrong
And it's a shame (It's a shame)
When you've got nothing left to say
And so you put it in a song but you only wanted to explain that

[Chorus]
It's a shame (It's a shame)
It's just a shame (It's a shame)
It's a shame (It's a shame)
It's just a shame (It's a shame)
It's a crying shame
It's a shame (It's a shame)
Oh, it's a shame (It's a shame, It's a shame)
It's a shame (It's a shame)
It's a shame (It's a shame)
It's a crying shame

[Non-Lyrical Outro]


Title: She Smokes in Bed

Lyrics:
Mary’s wiping ashes from her clothes
Blackened matches strewn across the floor
The smoke rose slowly and was pushed out by the vent
The guiding light was just the tip of her cigarette
She smokes in bed
Ba ba ba, ba ba ba da da da da da
Da da da
X2
Mary doesn’t care about herself
So what chance is there for anybody else
Sometimes I wonder about the heartache that lies ahead
Any day now she’ll set fire to her head
She smokes in bed
Ba ba ba, ba ba ba da da da da da
Da da da

X2

Nervous neighbors peeping through the blinds
Piercing sirens cutting through the night
Molten rubble settling to rest
They searched for hours
There wasn’t anybody left
She smoked in bed

Ba ba ba, ba ba ba da da da da da
Da da da
X4


Title: Sleeping with the Enemy

Lyrics:
Don't go sleeping with the enemy
I know we said we'd be true
I know you're stranded in the forest if you don't
Abandoned if you do

So don't go sleeping with the enemy
If my imagination is getting ahead of me
Then let it be known that I can't make it alone

So get down and stay perfectly still
Bite down on your cyanide pill
There's things that you swore you'd never do
But you will with the enemy

Don't go sleeping with the enemy
Then everybody gets to be a hero
Can ya hear me, are you alive?
Do you know that there's a war?

Don't go sleeping with the enemy
Don't forget that we were comrades till the end
They only wanna make love but this is war
And the good guys always win

So don't kick while we're dragging you home
Quietly reciting your loyalty oath
Knife at your throat
Uncomfortably close to the enemy


Title: Song About Me

Lyrics:
[Chorus: Roxanne Shanté]
I asked you a question, I wanna know why (And you don't know why)
Yeah, I wanna know why (And you don't know why)
Why'd you have to make a record 'bout me? (And you don't know why)
Why'd–Why'd you have to make a–Why'd you have to make a– (And you don't know why)
I wanna know why (And you don't know why)
Yeah, I wanna know why (And you don't know why)
Why'd you have to make a record 'bout me? (And you don't know why)
Why'd–Why'd you have to make a–Why'd you have to make a– (And you don't know why)

[Verse 1: Brad Petering, Roxanne Shanté]
I heard that you heard
That I was writing songs about you
That I was bad mouthing your name
In some shitty bar somewhere
You know how I love these biased, one-sided conversations
So let's discuss the whos, the whys, the whens, the hows, the wheres
But who really cares?
If it was all in my mind  (And you don't know why)
If it was all in my mind  (And you don't know why)
To begin with  (And you don't know why)
(Keep the chaos 'cause you don't know why)
If it was all in my mind  (And you don't know why)
If it was all in my mind (And you don't know why)
To begin with  (And you don't know why)
(Keep the chaos 'cause you don't know why)

[Chorus: Roxanne Shanté]
Yeah, I wanna know why (And you don't know why)
Yeah, I wanna know why (And you don't know why)
Why'd you have to make a record 'bout me? (And you don't know why)
Why'd–Why'd you have to make a–Why'd you have to make a– (And you don't know why)
I wanna know why (And you don't know why)
Yeah, I wanna know why (And you don't know why)
Why'd you have to make a record 'bout me? (And you don't know why)
Why'd–Why'd you have to make a–Why'd you have to make a– (And you don't know why)

[Verse 2: Brad Petering, Roxanne Shanté]
And I remember her bent over
And knowing that it was the last time
You know the end is near
If she only lets you fuck at night
And when she finally came even though she faked it
It was much appreciated
At least she had the decency
To try to make a sound that she thought I'd like
But it's alright
'Cause it was all in my mind (And you don't know why)
'Cause it was all in my mind (And you don't know why)
To begin with (And you don't know why)
(And you don't know why)
'Cause it was all in my mind (And you don't know why)
'Cause it was all in my mind (And you don't know why)
To begin with (And you don't know why)
(Keep the chaos 'cause you don't know why)

[Chorus: Roxanne Shanté]
I wanna know why (And you don't know why)
Yeah, I wanna know why (And you don't know why)
Why'd you have to make a record 'bout me? (And you don't know why)
Why'd–Why'd you have to make a–Why'd you have to make a– (And you don't know why)
I wanna know why (And you don't know why)
Yeah, I wanna know why (And you don't know why)
Why'd you have to make a record 'bout me? (And you don't know why)
Why'd–Why'd you have to make a–Why'd you have to make a– (And you don't know why)

[Verse 3: Maddie Acid,  Roxanne Shanté]
Yeah, I heard your song but I wasn't impressed
So, you got your feels hurt and now you're feeling depressed
Just because we had sex and it didn't last?
Now you want revenge, you wanna put me on blast?
Don't make me laugh, remember all those girls you played
With all the lies you told back in the day to get laid?
An excuse for Suzie, you got a story for Lori
And all those other girls you only called when you were horny  (Have to make a–Why'd you have to make a–)
So yeah, it's nothing that you didn't do first
The only difference is that you probably did it worse
So look at the big bad soldier
Declaring holy war on every girl who didn't mean to fuck him over
But karma's a bitch for hypocrites who kiss and tell
And talk shit about girls who only wished him well
So if you wanna chat, just stick to the facts and get at me
From Russia with love, Maddie

[Outro: Roxanne Shanté]
(And you don't know why, and you don't know why)
Why'd you have to make a record 'bout me? (And you don't know why)
Why'd–Why'd you have to make a– (And you don't know why)
Why'd you have to make a–
Why'd you have to make a– (And you don't know why)
Why'd you have to make a–
Why'd you have to make a– (And you don't know why)
Why'd you have to make a–
Why'd you have to make a record 'bout me? (And you don't know why)
Why'd–Why'd you have to make a– (And you don't know why)
Why'd–Why'd you have to make a record 'bout me?


Title: Speak French

Lyrics:
[Sample from "Un Petit Baiser" by Gillian Hills]:
(Da la la la la)
(Un petit baiser pour moi)
(Da la la la la)
(Un petit baiser pour moi)
(Da la la la la)
(Un gentil baiser pour nous)

(Da la la la la)
(Un baiser pour ton amour) [x4]

It ain't fun
Unless it hurts some
But y'all couldn't pull a trigger on a squirt-gun
Black eyes and loose teeth
Killing all your sons like Lou Reed
I'm vicious
Hit you with a flower
Smash your grill with a daffodil
And every motherfucker that be actin' ill
Use a sledgehammer just to smash a pill

I chop lines with a hatchet
It's why they call me "Acid"
But keep my name off your tongue
'Cause I've been known to go off in a rage
And do it in cold blood
Like Capote
Hand me the pipe so I can smoke peyote
'Til I start seeing blue coyotes
Until I come up with a new emoji
The slit throat
'Cause life's a sick joke
That's why I smoke cigs and sniff coke
I saw you at the disco
You tried to grab the microphone but your wrist broke
That's my two cents
Don't you give up on your rhymes for Lent
Before I grab a wrench
And hit you upside the head 'til you speak French

(Da la la la la)
(Un baiser pour ton amour)

[Sample from "Qui Sème le Vent Récolte le Tempo" by MC Solaar]


Title: Stay Away (It’s Like That)

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I should have known
By the way that you say nothing much at all
I could have guessed by the messages you send
But never call
But most of all
I could have seen it in the colors of your hair
Because they don't appear in nature
Except to warn you of the danger
And I know that you don't care

[Chorus]
But I want you to stay (stay)
I want you to stay (stay)
I want you to stay (stay)
Stay the hell away from me

[Verse 2]
I could have guessed
If I'd liked you a little less
I probably could have recognized the signs
But I don't mind when your roommate barges in
And lists off every single name but mine

But that's the way it goes
You'll always be the last to know
Till someone comes and slaps you on the face
But it's okay if you're at a loss for words
'Cause I know exactly what I'd say

[Chorus]
I'd tell you to stay (stay)
I'd tell you to stay (stay)
I'd tell you to stay (stay)
Stay the hell away from me

I want you to stay (stay)
I want you to stay (stay)
I want you to stay (stay)
Stay the hell away from me

[Bridge]
And despite all the silence
I heard about it anyway
Was it me or with Mike
Who stayed for the night?
But only Joe made it through to the day
And that was the summer
That's just life in LA
You're either screening your calls
Or begging for someone to stay

[Chorus]
Stay (stay)
Why don't you stay? (stay)
Why don't you stay? (stay)
Stay the hell away from me

I want you to stay (stay)
I want you to stay (stay)
I just wanted you to stay (stay)
Stay the hell away from me

[Outro]
Just stay the hell away from me
Stay the hell away from me
Just stay the hell away from me
Just stay the hell away from me
