Title: Affection

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I know that you say I get mean when I'm drinking, but
Then again, sometimes I get really sweet so
What does it mean if I tell you to go fuck yourself?
Or if I say that you're beautiful to me?

[Chorus]
It's affection, always
Ooh, you're gonna see it someday
My attention for you
Even if it's not what you need

[Verse 2]
Sometimes we talk all night long, we don't shut up
And when it's late, we'll say we're still wide awake so
We love to talk about how you'll come up to visit me
And we'll rent a car and we'll drive upstate

[Chorus]
It's affection, always
Ooh, you're gonna see it someday
My attention's on you
Even if it's not what you need

[Bridge]
I think of you, I want you too
I'd fall for you
I think of you, I want you too
I'd fall for you
I think of you, I want you too
I'd fall for you
I think of you, I want you too
I'd fall for you

[Outro]
It's affection, always
It's affection, always

Title: Apocalypse

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
You leapt from crumbling bridges watching cityscapes turn to dust
Filming helicopters crashing in the ocean from way above

[Chorus]
Got the music in you, baby, tell me why
Got the music in you, baby, tell me why
You've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye

[Verse 2]
Kisses on the foreheads of the lovers wrapped in your arms
You've been hiding them in hollowed out pianos left in the dark

[Chorus]
Got the music in you, baby, tell me why
Got the music in you, baby, tell me why
You've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye

[Bridge]
Your lips, my lips
Apocalypse
Your lips, my lips
Apocalypse
Go and sneak us through the rivers
Flood is rising up on your knees
Oh, please
Come out and haunt me, I know you want me
Come out and haunt me

[Verse 3]
Sharing all your secrets with each other since you were kids
Sleeping soundly with the locket that she gave you clutched in your fist

[Chorus]
Got the music in you, baby, tell me why
Got the music in you, baby, tell me why
You've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye
You've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye
[Outro]
Oh, when you're all alone
I will reach for you
When you're feeling low
I will be there too

Title: Bubblegum

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Lickin' the barrel of a gun
Chewin' it like it's bubblegum
Wave it like a magic wand
Pop a few rounds off just for fun

[Verse 2]
Go to the strip club all alone
Thinkin' that I could take you home
To picture you with those other guys
Is drivin' me crazy all the time

[Chorus]
Well, I never wanted to be with you
But I think I'm falling, so what can I do?
You'll just lead me on 'til I'm drowning in tears

[Bridge]
Oh, and you're holdin' me
Oh, and you're holdin' me
Oh, and you're holdin' me
As if I was the
Last man standing on earth

Well, I never wanted to be with you
But I think I'm falling, so what can I do?
You'll just lead me on 'til I'm drowning in tears


Title: Crush

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I wanna line my walls with photographs you sent
Of you lying in your swimsuit on the bed
Can't live without your love inside me now
I'll find a way to slip into your skin, somehow

[Chorus]
I wanna fuck your love slow
Catch my heart, go swim
Feel your lips crush
Hold you here, my loveliest friend

[Instumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
I love to watch you when you're trying on your clothes
And now you're all I think about when I'm alone
Can't wait to feel your love inside me now
We'll have a drink or two and we'll go to your house

[Chorus]
I wanna fuck your love slow
Catch my heart, go swim
Feel your lips crush
Hold you here, my loveliest friend

[Instumental Bridge]

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
It's making you cry every time
You give your love to me this way
Saying you'd wait for me to stay
I know it hurts you

[Chorus]
But I need to tell you something
My heart just can't be faithful for long
I swear I'll only make you cry

[Verse 2]
Maybe I'd change for you someday
But I can't help the way I feel
Wish I was good
Wish that I could give you my love now

[Chorus]
But I need to tell you something
My heart just can't be faithful for long
I swear I'll only make you cry

[Instrumental Break]

I need to tell you something
My heart just can't be faithful for long
I swear I'll only make you cry


Title: Dark Vacay

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
In summer I'm living on pills and lines
With someone I love, I don't really like
Been sleeping on the tile and keeping out the light
Then sipping Château Lafite Rothschild
[Pre-Chorus]
So come on, come on, dark star
Been loving you and I can't get enough, dark star
We don't need Brazzers

[Chorus]
Feel the world around you
Feel the world surround you
Feel the world around you
Feel it all around you crash

[Verse 2]
With summertime liquor at 5 o'clock
Been drinking too heavy on Adderall
I listen to the last message that you left
Then the voice from the suicide hotline

[Pre-Chorus]
So come on, come on, dark star
Been loving you and I can't get enough, dark star
We don't need Brazzers

[Chorus]
Feel the world around you
Feel the world surround you
Feel the world around you
Feel it all around you crash

[Chorus]
Feel the world around you
Feel the world surround you
Feel the world around you
Feel it all around you crash and fall

Crash and fall
Crash and fall


Title: Don’t Let Me Go

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
When I was young, I thought the world of you
You were all that I wanted then
It faded and I never saw you again
But I won't forget the love we had

[Chorus]
Come to me now
Don't let me go
Stay by my side
Don't let me go
Stay with me still
I've missed you so

[Verse 2]
When I was young, I thought the world of you
I was dumb to let you drift away
And though I guess it had to come to an end
No one else could have the love we shared

[Chorus]
Come to me now
Don't let me go
Stay by my side
And my heart goes
Out to you
Wherever you are

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Come to me now
Don't let me go
Stay by my side
Don't let me go
Stay with me still
I've missed you so


Title: Do You Know Where I Should Go?

Do you know where I should go?
Feels like death

Do you know where I should go?
Feels like death

Memory
Memory
Memory

Do you know where I should go?
Feels like death


Title: Dreaming of You

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Seen you from afar
Wondered who you are
Wondered what you're like
Think you're just my type

[Chorus]
And now I'm dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming of you
And now I'm dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming of you

[Verse 2]
Want you, yes, I do
Bet you never knew it
Think you'd suit me fine
Want you all the time

[Chorus]
And now I'm dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming of you
And now I'm dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming of you

[Bridge]
You're the one I'm calling on
You're the one who's calling me to have it
You're the one I'm calling on
You're the one who's calling me to have it
You're the one I'm calling on
You're the one who's calling me to have it
You're the one I'm calling on
You're the one who's calling me to have it

[Chorus]
Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming of you
Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming of you
Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming of you
Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming of you


Title: Dreams From Bunker Hill

Lyrics:
None


Title: Each Time You Fall in Love

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Each time you fall in love
It's clearly not enough
You sleep all day and drive out in L.A
It isn't safe
And each time you kiss a girl
You never know what it's worth
You say all of the words they wanna hear
It isn't real

[Chorus]
She took you for a ride in summer, baby
Lost all your money to her
All I wanna know is if you love her
How come you never give in?

[Verse 2]
Each time you have a dream
You never know what it means
You see that open road and never know which way to go
And each time you fall in love
It's clearly not enough
You sleep all day and drive out in L.A
It isn't safe

[Chorus]
She took you for a ride in summer, baby
Lost all your money to her
All I wanna know is if you love her
How come you never give in?


Title: Every Light Is Out

Lyrics:
As I walk down your street

I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming

Every

Every light is out

As I walk down your street

I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming


Title: Falling in Love

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
When I hold you close to me
I could always see a house by the ocean
Last night I could hear the waves
As I heard you say, "All that I want is to be yours"

[Chorus]
Falling in love
Falling in love
Deeper than I've felt it before
With you, baby
I feel I'm falling in love with all my heart

[Verse 2]
Back when you were far away
We would go on dates to watch the same movie
And you were imagining sitting next to me
Holding my hand for the whole thing

[Chorus]
Falling in love
Falling in love
Deeper than I've felt it before
With you, baby
I feel I'm falling in love with all my heart

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Falling in love
Falling in love
Deeper than I've felt it before
With you, baby
I feel I'm falling in love with all my heart


Title: Flash

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I'm a flash, oh, you were blinded by the love I had
I'm a flash, the light could only get in through the cracks

[Chorus]
And you've gotta do the right thing, do the right thing, baby
You're the white swan in the photograph
Do the right thing, do the right thing, baby
You're the white swan in the photograph

[Verse 2]
When they crashed the helicopters in my heart, it ripped
Cut in half, you saw me lying there bleeding to death

[Chorus]
And you had to do the right thing, do the right thing, baby
You're the white swan in the photograph
Do the right thing, do the right thing, baby
You're the white swan in the photograph

[Bridge]
Now I stand on the stage
I forget my lines to your play "Satan's Imagination"
And a voice in my head's causing suicide searching for any way to remember them

[Chorus]
And you've got to do the right thing, do the right thing, baby
You're the white swan in the photograph
Do the right thing, do the right thing, baby
You're the white swan in my photograph


Title: Heavenly

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Wanting your love to come into me
Feeling it slow, over this dream
Touch me with a kiss
Touch me with a kiss
Now you're above feeling it still
Tell me it's love, tell me it's real
Touch me with a kiss, feel me on your lips

[Chorus]
'Cause this is where
I wanna be
Where it's so sweet
And heavenly
I'm giving you all my, giving you all my
Giving you all my love
Giving you all my, giving you all my
Giving you all my love
All my love

[Verse 2]
Needing you now to come into me
Feeling it slow, over this dream
Touch me with a kiss
Feel me on your lips

Tell me it's love, tell me it's real
Touch me with a kiss, touch me with a kiss

[Chorus]
'Cause this is where
I wanna be
Where it's so sweet
And heavenly
I'm giving you all my, giving you all my
Giving you all my love
Giving you all my, giving you all my
Giving you all my love
All my love

And when you're far away
I still feel it all
And when you're far away
I still feel it all the same
And when you're far away, far away

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
I'm giving you all my, giving you all my
Giving you all my love
Giving you all my, giving you all my
Giving you all my love


Title: Hentai

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
There was a hentai video that I saw
I told you about the night that we first made love
About a girl who as soon as she made you cum
Could show you the future and tell you your fortune

[Chorus]
Beautiful hearts are in your eyes
I've been waiting for you to fall for me
And let me in your life
I've been waiting for you

[Verse 2]
Told you I wanted to die in an airplane crash
Over the ocean, that it was romantic
But you didn't like it, thought it was stupid, and
Thinking of me dead was making you feel bad

[Chorus]
Beautiful hearts are in your eyes
I've been waiting for you to fall for me
And let me in your life
I've been waiting for you

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Beautiful hearts are in your eyes
I've been waiting for you to fall for me
And let me in your life
I've been waiting for you

Title: I Can See You

Lyrics:
I can feel you
I can see you
See you swimming through the night
See you naked
Feel the water
Running 'round and 'round your inner thigh

I can feel you
I can see you
See you swimming through the night
See you naked
Feel the water
Running 'round and 'round your inner thigh

Make love to me inside the darkness
Make love to me inside the darkness

Now we're walking by the river
Now we're strolling by the lake
Now we're walking to the ocean
I can see you want to take my hand

Make love to me inside the darkness
Make lovе to me inside the darknеss

I can see your clothes are soaked
By all of the rain that fell
Don't you wonder why it smells that way?
I gave you a rose that day
I took all its thorns away
Don't you wonder why it smells that way?
That way

Now we're walking by the river
Now we're strolling to the lake
Now we're walking by the ocean
I can see you want to take my hand
My hand, my hand, my hand, my hand


Title: I Can’t Stop These Tears from Falling

Lyrics:
I used to go out at night
I used to go out each day
I used to go out & feel the sun on the silent day
So it's coming as quite a shock
A heart could come so undone
The strings could unravel fast
How quickly the war is won

& I can't stop these tears from falling
Right away
I know you're calling

I can't stop these tears from falling now

If I was the thinking heart
& you were the loving soul
With all of my feelings sharp
You came crashing in my world
A music of cathedrals
Bouncing along the glass
It's echoing through my ears
You took it away so fast

Oh well
The lights are low
& I don't need a friend to call my own
'cause I know it's the end
It's the end


Title: I’m a Firefighter

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Baby, I'm a firefighter trapped in a burning house in a silent picture
And there is no way out except to watch the love between us die

[Verse 2]
That's called the Falling Angel
It's an amusement park ride
Some sort of rollercoaster
It takes you up and when it brings you down
It gives you butterflies

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
And now I'm longing for your kiss
Bet you could read it on my lips
Ohh
Waterfalls, I'm jumping down

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
I know you're leaving, baby
The birds are flying south
And there's nothing to say
I need you here
I need your love inside of mine like I could die
I need your love inside of mine like I could die


Title: John Wayne

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
He's got so much love for her
But he doesn't know what to do
Sitting in the car
Waiting outside her school

[Pre-Chorus]
He's in for a heartbreak
If it's all been blind faith
From my point of view

[Chorus]
Baby, he's got to be crazy
Living like he's John Wayne
Always facing the world
Or chasing the girl
Baby, he's got to be crazy

[Verse 2]
He's got so much in his heart
But he doesn't know what to do
All he wants is her
Lying inside his room

[Pre-Chorus]
He's always feeling cheated,
Telling all his secrets
That I couldn't keep

[Chorus]
Baby, he's got to be crazy
Living like he's John Wayne
Always facing the world
Or chasing the girl
Baby, he's got to be crazy
Baby, he's got to be crazy
Living like he's John Wayne
Always facing the world
Or chasing the girl
Baby, he's got to be crazy


Title: K.

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I remember when I first noticed that you liked me back
We were sitting down in a restaurant, waiting for the check
We had made love earlier that day with no strings attached
But I could tell that something had changed, how you looked at me then

[Chorus]
Kristen, come right back
I've been waiting for you
To slip back in bed
When you light the candle

[Verse 2]
And on the Lower East Side, you're dancing with me now
And I'm taking pictures of you with flowers on the wall
Think I like you best when you're dressed in black from head to toe
Think I like you best when you're just with me and no one else

[Chorus]
Kristen, come right back
I've been waiting for you
To slip back in bed
When you light the candle

[Verse 3]
And I'm kissing you, lying in my room
Holding you until you fall asleep
And it's just as good as I knew it would be
Stay with me, I don't want you to leave

[Chorus]
Kristen, come right back
I've been waiting for you
To slip back in bed
When you light the candle


Title: Keep On Loving You

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
You should have seen by the look in my eyes
That there was somethin' missin'
You should have known by the tone of my voice
But you didn't listen
You play dead, but you never bled
Instead you lie still in the grass all coiled up and hissin'

[Verse 2]
And I know all about those men
Still I don't remember
'Cause it was us, baby, way before them
And we're still together

[Pre-Chorus]
And I meant every word I said
When I said that I love you I meant that I love you forever

[Chorus]
And I'm gonna keep on lovin' you
'Cause it's the only thing I wanna do
I don't wanna sleep
I just wanna keep on lovin' you

[Interlude]

[Pre-Chorus]
And I meant every word that I said
When I said that I love you I meant that I love you forever

[Chorus]
And I'm gonna keep on lovin' you
'Cause it's the only thing I wanna do
I don't wanna sleep
I just wanna keep on lovin' you

[Outro]
I don't wanna sleep
I just wanna keep on lovin' you


Title: Kiss It Off Me

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Saw you on the side of the road
I could see you were walkin' slow
Drinkin' a Slurpee
In a peach baseball cap
Fallin' in my lap
You were so thirsty

[Pre-Chorus]
Could you love me instead
Of all the boyfriends you get?
Know I'd make you forget
About all of those rich fuckboys

[Chorus]
Kiss it off me
If you're gonna break my heart
This is a good start
Kiss it off me

[Verse 2]
You always bite your lip
When you're feelin' it
As we move slowly
And your peach baseball cap
Is tossed under the rack
Of clothes and your jewelry

[Pre-Chorus]
And you beg for it
In the morning again
Before you go to the gym
Said it's a bad habit you just can't quit

[Chorus]
Kiss it off me
If you're gonna break my heart
This is a good start
Kiss it off me

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
Kiss it off me
If you're gonna break my heart
This is a good start
Kiss it off me
If you're gonna break my heart
This is a good start
Kiss it off me


Title: Lay Here

Lyrics:
Stoned like I lay here
Lay here
Lay here

Stoned like I lay here
Lay here
Lay here alone

When you were on the ground

& it's driving me crazy
& it's driving me crazy
& it's driving me crazy
& it's driving me crazy
& it's driving me crazy
& it's driving me crazy
& it's driving me crazy
& it's driving me crazy


Title: Motion Picture Soundtrack

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
White wine and sleeping pills
Help me get back to your arms
Cheap sex and sad films
Help me get where I belong

[Chorus]
I think you're crazy, baby
I think you're crazy, baby

[Verse 2]
Stop sending letters
Letters always get burned
It's not like the movies
They fed us on little white lies

[Chorus]
I think you're crazy, baby
I think you're crazy, baby

[Bridge]
I will see you in the next life

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
I think you're crazy, baby
I think you're crazy, baby
I think you're crazy, baby
I think you're crazy, baby


Title: Neon Moon

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
When the sun goes down on my side of town
That lonesome feeling comes to my door
The whole world turns blue
There's a rundown bar 'cross the railroad tracks
I've got a table for two way in the back
Where I sit alone and think of you

[Pre-Chorus]
I spend most every night
Beneath the light of a neon moon

[Chorus]
If you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams of a neon moon

[Verse 2]
I think of two young lovers running wild and free
I close my eyes, and sometimes see
You in the shadows of this smoke-filled room
No telling how many tears I've sat here and cried
Or how many lies that I've lied
Telling my poor heart you'll come back one day

[Pre-Chorus]
I spend most every night
Beneath the light of a neon moon

[Chorus]
If you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams of a neon moon

[Outro]
But I'll be alright as long as there's light
From a neon moon
And I'll be alright as long as there's light
From a neon moon


Title: Night Train

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Used to be around
Lost and found
Thinking it's good
That's the way it should
Standing in the rain
Waiting for the train
'Cause I miss you, honey
Baby, I do, I do
Can't take it anymore
Going next door
Gonna find out
What it's all about
I'm standing in the rain
Waiting for the train
'Cause I miss you, honey
Baby, I do, I do

[Chorus]
And I want you, want you
Kept out, baby, on the night train
I want you, want you
Kept out, baby, on the night train
Well, I want you, want you
And I'm kept out, baby, on the night train
I want you, want you
Kept out, baby

[Verse 2]
No, it's not right
When you're out of sight
Feeling so slow
Letting you go
'Cause I need your helping hand
Oh, I need it bad
'Cause I miss you, honey
Baby, I do, I do

[Chorus]
And I want you, want you
Kept out, baby, on the night train
I want you, want you
Kept out, baby, on the night train
Well, I want you, want you
Kept out, baby, on the night train
I want you, want you
Kept out, baby
On the night train

[Bridge]
And I'm not gonna go back home
And I'm not gonna go back home
And I'm not gonna go back home
Gonna go back home

[Chorus]
'Cause I want you, want you
Kept out, baby, on the night train
I want you, want you
Kept out, baby, on the night train
Well, I want you, want you
And I'm kept out, baby, on the night train
I want you, want you
Kept out, baby
On the night train, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah


Title: Nothing’s Gonna Hurt You Baby

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Whispered something in your ear
It was a perverted thing to say
But I said it anyway
Made you smile and look away

[Chorus]
Nothing's gonna hurt you baby
As long as you're with me you'll be just fine
Nothing's gonna hurt you baby
Nothing's gonna take you from my side

[Verse 2]
When we dance in my living room
To that silly 90's R&B
When we have a drink or three
Always ends in a hazy shower scene

[Chorus]
Nothing's gonna hurt you baby
As long as you're with me you'll be just fine
Nothing's gonna hurt you baby
Nothing's gonna take you from my side

[Bridge]
When we laugh into the microphone and sing
With our sunglasses on to our favorite songs
When we're laughing in the microphone and singing
With our sunglasses on to our favorite songs

[Outro]
Nothing's gonna hurt you baby
Nothing's gonna take you from my side


Title: On Repeat

Lyrics:
[Intro: Greg Gonzalez]
Where the girls are young and down
And hot as fuck
Where they're dancing in the streets
With nothing on

[Verse 1: Goody Grace]
Drivin' all night, lost track of time
All these lonely roads aren't how they used to feel
Big dreams in our eyes, carefree, yet so blind
Been afraid of anything that's real
Watch the sunset through highway fields (Highway fields)
If I could go back then I'd stay there (I'd stay there)
Just us wrapped up in the Autumn air (In the Autumn air)
Act like I don't but I'll always care (I'll always care)
Oh babe, I'm gon' go

[Chorus: Greg Gonzalez]
Where the girls are young and down
And hot as fuck
Whеre they're dancing in thе streets
With nothing on
We'll drive your car to the beach with this song on repeat
You showed me
We'll drive your car to the beach with this song on repeat
Oh, baby

[Verse 2: Lexi Jayde]
Stood on the edge
We never said
Anything that felt too honest
In the backseat
Kicked off your Nikes
My hand in your jacket pocket but
Some love just lasts a season
It gets fucked up for no good reason (oooh)
Been trying to find the feeling
That we had
Let’s go back
No one has to know
Just want to go

[Chorus: Greg Gonzalez & Lexi Jayde]
Where the girls are young and down
And hot as fuck
Where they're dancing in the streets
With nothing on
We'll drive your car to the beach with this song on repeat
You showed me
We'll drive your car to the beach with this song on repeat
Oh, baby


Title: Opera House

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Built an opera house for you in the deepest jungle
And I walked across its stage, singing with my eyes closed
I've got a love for you I just can't escape
All of my love for you cuts me like barbed wire

[Chorus]
Ooh, I was meant to love you
And always keep you in my life
Ooh, I was meant to love you
I knew I loved you at first sight

[Verse 2]
If I abandoned love, I'd be a man without dreams (ooh)
I'd rather be out there staring death right between its eyes now
And I can still hear the sound of you crying through the night
There in the opera house with no one else for miles

[Chorus]
Ooh, I was meant to love you
And always keep you in my life
Ooh, I was meant to love you
I knew I loved you at first sight

[Outro]
Ooh, I was meant to love you
And always keep you in my life
Ooh, I was meant to love you
I knew I loved you at first sight

Title: Pistol

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Give me the pistol
Aim it high
I'm out in the desert
Shooting at the sky
Guess I really miss you
And I don't know what else to do

[Verse 2]
Beautiful pictures
That you took of us
Used to hang up there
On your bedroom walls
But you took 'em all down now
And you put 'em into a drawer

[Chorus]
You've been on my mind
You've been on my mind
You've been on my mind so long
I can't deal with it
You've been on my mind
And I'll waste my time
'Til you lift me off the floor
And love me again

[Verse 3]
I know if I saw you
And we kissed just once
You could be happy
Maybe you'd come back
'Cause I really miss you
Don't know how much more I can take

[Chorus]
You've been on my mind
You'vе been on my mind
You've been on my mind so long
I can't deal with it
You've been on my mind
And I'll wastе my time
'Til you lift me off the floor
And love me again

[Outro]
Oh, yeah
'Til you lift me off the floor
And love me again
Oh, yeah


Title: Please Don’t Cry

Lyrics:
Please don't cry, my love, goodbye, oh
Please don't cry, my love, goodbye
I want to stay, but now it's time
So please don't cry, my love

Please don't cry, my love, goodbye
Please don't cry, my love, goodbye
'Cause I want to stay, but now it's time
So please don't cry, my love

Please don't stay that way
Please don't stay
'Cause you know that it's hard when you look that way
Know that it's hard when you talk that way
So please don't say

Please don't cry, my love, goodbye
Please don't cry, my love, goodbye
'Cause I want to stay, but now it's time
So please don't cry, my love, hey

Please don't cry, my love, goodbye
Please don't cry, my love, goodbye
'Cause I want to stay, but now it's time
So please don't cry, my love

'Cause you know that it's hard when you look that way
Know that it's hard when you talk that way
You know that it's hard when you look that way
And you know that it's hard when you talk that way, so

Please don't say goodbye
Please don't say goodbye
Please
Please
Please don't say goodbye
Please don't say goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye


Title: Pure

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
When you walk in the room
In a white bodysuit
And I say, "Take it off"
So you tell me to watch

[Chorus]
When it's pure
Only your love could get me to fall
When it's deep, gets so hot
And it's so beautiful

[Verse 2]
And the TV is on
When we make love because
We get carried away
We don't care anyway

[Chorus]
When it's pure
Only your love could get me to fall
When it's deep, gets so hot
And it's so beautiful

[Verse 3]
Wrapped your hair in a towel
But I watch you let it down
And it's all soaking wet
As you take me in your mouth
And we stare at the street
From the back balcony
But now all I can see
Is you undressing for me

[Chorus]
When it's pure
Only your love could get me to fall
When it's deep, gets so hot
And it's so beautiful


Title: Run Towards Your Fear

Lyrics:
Here, right here
When it's too much for me to take

They can't see straight
When it's too much for you to take

You're the only one
You're the only one

I'm the only one

You're dressed in black & following the purple string
So run towards your fears
When it's too much for you to take

I can't believe the way you breathe
On the mirror leaves often marks
I draw your name inside the cloud
You laugh
So what begins?


Title: Sesame Syrup

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Staring at your Kate Moss shower curtain
Lying on the bathroom floor naked
Hiding coke inside all your orange Pixy Stix
You take a rail & spread it on your tit

[Pre-Chorus]
You've had a long list of lovers
But none of them matter to you except me
I've had a long list of lovers
But none of them matter to me except you

[Chorus]
Sesame syrup
I heard it a long time ago
Sesame syrup
I heard it a long time ago

[Verse 2]
There's a small black notebook that you keep hidden underneath your bed
I've seen before
It says every dirty thing that you did with every single boy
You've ever been with

[Pre-Chorus]
You've had a long list of lovers
But none of them matter to you except me
I've had a long list of lovers
But none of them matter to me except you

[Chorus]
Sesame syrup
I heard it a long time ago
Sesame syrup
I heard it a long time ago

[Bridge]
And we fall asleep to the scent
Sleep to the scent of long stemmed roses
Always dreaming of sex
Dreaming of sex on the ceiling
And we sleep to the scent
Sleep to the scent of long stemmed roses
Always dreaming of sex
Dreaming of sex on the ceiling

[Chorus]
Sesame syrup
I heard it a long time ago
Sesame syrup
I heard it a long time ago


Title: Silver Sable

Lyrics:
None


Title: Sing

Lyrics:
Sing
Take me on the wing
I could be forever scattered through the wind
Feels like a sin
Feels like a call into the forest
Living like a bird

Flying through the air
I don't feel anymore
Coming through
Forces on the light
& I know that
Come & laugh
When you said
I get away

I'm falling through
Every single word is another river
Taking off her clothes
Taking off her dress
Now it's all white
& the yellow sun is feeling like a bite

I don't care anymore
I don't see it again
When you follow me left
Into the lens with the camera now
I don't feel like coming back again
I don't feel a floor

Feels a little strange...


Title: Spanish Prayers

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
And on this time before I could tell
Threw my last wish into the well
And I was making to leave
Just when you said "Won't you come home with me?"

[Verse 2]
And as we walk I tell you the tale
Of when I was so broke, wounded and frailed
They built a statue of me
Standing right there
[?] from the arms of the chair
Filled up my lungs with [?] air
[?] inside a jumping balloon

[Chorus]
We’re running into our love
Banging a spanish drum
Locked in a cathedral
Drinking the spanish rum
We are members of a clan
Even if they don't care
Blowing all the speakers
Singing a spanish prayer slowly

[Verse 3]
[?] tears right to my eyes
What a surprise
That I'm here watching you now
Getting undressed
[?] dreams with their hearts on their sleeves
In the middle of a night makes me cry
That I’m looking for you standing right there

[Chorus]
We're running into our love
Banging a spanish drum
Then we're locked in a cathedral
Drinking the spanish rum
We are members of a clan
Even if they don't care
Blowing all the speakers
Singing a spanish prayer slowly


Title: Starry Eyes

Lyrics:
[Chorus]
Starry eyes
How can I get to you, my true little
Starry eyes?
What can I say or do for you, my little
Starry eyes?
Starry eyes forever
Shall be mine
Starry eyes
What can I say to make you listen?
Starry eyes
What can I do for your attention?
Starry eyes
Starry eyes forever
Shall be mine

[Verse]
When I'm alone, I hear and feel you
Wish that I could reach right out and touch you
But knowing you're the one to greet me, and meet me
Two alone in the dark, may it be

[Chorus]
Starry eyes
The sparks will fall on me
Starry eyes
Won't you listen that I'm here being
For you, starry eyes?
Starry eyes forever
Shall be mine

[Outro]
Starry eyes forever
Shall be mine


Title: Stop Waiting

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
In her favorite locket, hiding yellow pills
With white wine to chase them, lying on the hills
We kissed until we couldn't breathe
The coldest sand is on the beach

[Verse 2]
Now she's in her swimsuit with the yellow straps
Cutting it with scissors 'til there's nothing left
And rubbing sunscreen on her breasts
She's putting on her sunglasses

[Chorus]
I could win, I could lose
But that's a look I can't refuse
I could win, I could lose
But that's a look I can't refuse
Stop waiting

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I could win, I could lose
But that's a look I can't refuse
I could win, I could lose
But that's a look I can't refuse
Stop waiting


Title: Sunsetz

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Sunsets
We wander through a foreign town
Strangely, there's nobody else around
So you open your dress and show me your tits
On the swing set at the old playground

[Chorus]
And when you go away, I still see you
With sunlight on your face in my rear-view

[Verse 2]
Sunsets
I wanna hear your voice
A love that nobody could destroy
Took photographs like Brautigan's book covers
That we both adored

[Chorus]
And when you go away, I still see you
With sunlight on your face in my rear view
This always happens to me this way
Recurring visions of such sweet days
And when you go away, I still see you
With sunlight on your face in my rear view
When you go away, I still see you
With sunlight on your face in my rear view


Title: Sweet

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Watching the video that you sent me
The one where you're showering with wet hair dripping
You know that I'm obsessed with your body
But it's the way you smile that does it for me

[Chorus]
It's so sweet, knowing that you love me
Though we don't need to say it to each other, sweet
Knowing that I love you, and running my fingers through your hair
It's so sweet

[Verse 2]
Watching the video where you're lying
In your red lingerie ten times nightly
You know I think your skin's the perfect color
But it's always your eyes that pull me under

[Chorus]
It's so sweet, knowing that you love me
Though we don't need to say it to each other, sweet
Knowing that I love you, and running my fingers through your hair
It's so sweet

[Bridge]
And I will gladly break it, I will gladly break my heart for you
And I will gladly break it, I will gladly break my heart for you
And I will gladly break it, I will gladly break my heart for you
And I will gladly break it, I will gladly break my heart for you

[Chorus]
It's so sweet, knowing that you love me
Though we don't need to say it to each other, sweet
Knowing that I love you, and running my fingers through your hair
It's so sweet


Title: Tejano Blue

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
We wanted to fuck with real love
Wanted it sweet, so pure and warm
Never only sleepin' over
We wanted to fuck like all the time
And when you got back from your flight
It was the first thing we did

[Pre-Chorus]
And when you say you want it all
I know you want it all
Baby, take it all from me
And when you drag me on the floor
And the blue Tejano's on
You keep your eyes on me

[Chorus]
So get in the waves, swim in your leather
I always will make it feel like you were the last one
So get in the waves like it was the first time
Bless your heart, make you part of my life forever

[Verse 2]
In shorts so high-waist
The girl in the arcade
Said they were the shortest-ever
And the rest like "Holiday"
The live one where she sang
Dancin' in a polka-dot top

[Pre-Chorus]
And when you say you want it all
I know you want it all
Baby, take it all from me
And when you drag me on the floor
And the blue Tejano's on
You keep your eyes on me

[Chorus]
So get in the waves, swim in your leather
I always will make it feel like you were the last one
So get in the waves like it was the first time
Bless your heart, make you part of my life forever
Get in the waves, swim in your leather
I always will make it feel like you were the last one
So get in the waves like it was the first time
Bless your heart, make you part of my life forever, and always
And always


Title: Touch

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Oh, I missed you and I cried
But I said that I was alright
And I know it's been a while
Since I needed a distraction

[Pre-Chorus]
’Cause I wanna do everything
That you want me to, to tell you the truth
I need to stay alive
So sad that I could die

[Chorus]
It's leading me on, every time we touch
Leading me on, every time it hurts
Feeling so lonely, 'cause it’s not enough
Missin' you only, ever since we fell in love

[Verse 2]
And I watched you do a line
That you spread out on the table
I don't need to see you wired
I just wanna see you upside down

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna do everything
That you want me to, to tell you the truth
I listen to you cry all night
Through the telephone

[Chorus]
It's leading me on, every time we touch
Leading me on, every time it hurts
Feeling so lonely, 'cause it's not enough
Missin' you only, ever since we fell in love

[Verse 3]
Couldn't say you didn’t want me then
When we were lyin’ in my bed that night
You were acting like a different person
As if suddenly you wanted to just be friends
I was hurt and so I took a shower
So you couldn't hear me, knowing I had to cry
Sad to know that while my heart was breaking
You were sleeping or just faking

[Chorus]
It’s leading me on, every time we touch
Leading me on, every time it hurts
Feeling so lonely, 'cause it's not enough
Missin' you only, ever since we fell in love
