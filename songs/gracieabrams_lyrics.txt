Title: 21

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I missed your twenty-first birthday, I've been up at home
Almost tried to call you, don't know if I should
Hate to picture you half-drunk happy
Hate to think you went out without me
I'm sorry if you blame me, if I were you, I would
Thought you'd see it comin', but you never could
I still haven't heard from your family
But you said your mom always loved me

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes I go blurry-eyed
Small talk and you tell me that you're on fire
Lights on and it's black and white, I couldn't stay forever

[Chorus]
I see the look in your eye and I'm bitin' my tongue
You'll be the love of my life when I was young
When the night is over
Don't call me up, I'm already under
I get a little bit alone sometimes and I miss you again
I'll be the love of your life inside your head
When the night is over
Don't call me up, I'm already under

[Verse 2]
Audrey said she saw you out past 12 o'clock
Just because you're hurtin' doesn't mean I'm not
If it doesn't go away by the time I turn thirty
I made a mistake and I'll tell you I'm sorry
"Sorry"

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes I go blurry-eyed
Small talk and you tell me that you're on fire
Lights on and it's black and white, I couldn't stay forever

[Chorus]
I see the look in your eye and I'm bitin' my tongue
You'll be the love of my life when I was young
When the night is over
Don't call me up, I'm already under
I get a little bit alone sometimes and I miss you again
I'll be the love of your life inside your head
When the night is over
Don't call me up, I'm already under


Title: 405

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I, I took the 405
I drove a hundred miles an hour to forget you
And I blew through the traffic light
If I were to go tonight, I think I would regret you

[Chorus]
You took the half of me that I needed
And how'd you walk away so easy?
It's almost like you like to let me down
You took half of me, could you leave it?
And go back to when we were speakin'
I hate the fact that I miss you around

[Verse 2]
Please, you won't even look at me
It's getting embarrassin', I'm cryin' to my family
And now, I'm, I'm harder to recognize 'cause
I cut all my hair last night while you think of me barely

[Chorus]
You took the half of me that I needed
And how'd you walk away so easy?
It's almost like you like to let me down
You took the half of me, could you leave it?
And go back to when we were speakin'
I hate the fact that I miss you around

[Bridge]
Tell me why, how the hell I slipped your mind?
You forgot me overnight, didn't even try to hide it
All the while, lost my head and appetite
You've consumed, like, all my nights, now I know it's unrequited
'Cause I, I took the 405
I drove a hundred miles an hour to forget you, mm

[Chorus]
You took the half of me, that I needed
And how'd you walk away so easy?
It's almost like you like to let me down, down
You took half of me, could you leave it?
And go back to when we were speakin'
I hate the fact that I miss you around


Title: Abby

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Climb up the ivy, come through the window
Hide from your family, here with your face close
Tell on your brother, how he's been so cold
I'll make you dinner, put on your headphones
Tune out the bad news, letters from college
You miss your best friend, she should be calling
Just fall asleep right here on the carpet
I'd never wake you, stay 'til the mornin' light

[Chorus]
I'm right here, fall to me, to me
Fill your head with sweet dreams, sweet dreams
You'd never hurt a thing, nothing
I hope you know to talk to me

[Verse 2]
When we were little, we shared a haircut
Wanted to kill you, I was embarrassed
Mothers insisted that we would grow up
And things would be different 'cause we would be closer
Tell me your secrets, ask every question
My door is open 24/7
Think you were made from somethin' in heaven
You made me love the number eleven

[Chorus]
I'm, I'm right here, fall to me, to me
Fill your head with sweet dreams, sweet dreams
You'd never hurt a thing, nothing
I hope you know to talk to me, mm

[Verse 3]
I was just thinking, do you remember
Going to New York back in November?
Swallowing chocolate, sharin' a king bed
Judgin' an album, judging my boyfriend
Isn't it funny, we're getting older
You used to fit right up on my shoulders
I can't believe our childhood is over
I'm really grateful I get to know you

[Chorus]
I'm, I'm right here, fall to me, to me
Fill your head with sweet dreams, sweet dreams
You'd never hurt a thing, nothing
I hope you know to talk to me
I'm right here, fall to me, to me
Fill your head with sweet dreams, sweet dreams
You'd never hurt a thing, nothing
I hope you know to talk to me


Title: A Little More (Snippet)

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Hey, you
Hey, mister knock-on-my-door
I'm sorry that I've been emotion's galore
I'm crazy for wanting a little bit more
A little more of you
A little more, a little more of you

[Verse 2]
This feeling's hard to ignore
Can't say I've done this before
I'm crazy for wanting a little bit more
A little more of you
A little more, a little more of you


Title: Alright

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I still avoid medication
I'd rather take a vacation
Drive around all of the outlets
Buy things and later regret it
Spend the whole week in Hawaii
Fall asleep under the palm trees
Down a whole bottle of whiskey
Counting the people who hate me

[Chorus]
I don't know if I'll be alright
What will it take to make this good?
Oh, someone tell me it gets better, better, better, better
Because for tonight, I'm just not alright

[Verse 2]
What if I drove to you backwards?
Jump in the shallow end headfirst
Burn my emergency contact
Run for the hills when it gets bad
What if I never move out?
I'd live in the basement my whole life
I got the chills when I said that
I never thought of a fallback

[Chorus]
I don't know if I'll be alright (Alright)
What will it take to make this good?
Oh, someone tell me it gets better, better, better, better
Because for tonight, I'm just not alright


Title: Amelie

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I met a girl once
She sorta ripped me open
She doesn't even know it
She doesn't know my name
We sat on the sofa
She asked me a million questions
I answered and by eleven
Memorized her face

[Chorus]
Where did you go
Amelie, Amelie, Amelie?
Where'd you go?
Or were you all in a dream
Amelie, Amelie?
I don't know

[Verse 2]
Why'd it feel louder
When all of it went unspoken?
All I can do is hope that
This will go away
She had her hair up
She cried about her obsessions
But she doesn't know I'd let her
Ruin all my days

[Chorus]
Where did you go
Amelie, Amelie, Amelie?
Where'd you go?
Or were you all in a dream
Amelie, Amelie?
I don't know
Where did you go
Amelie, Amelie, Amelie?
Where'd you go?
Or were you all in a dream
Amelie, Amelie?
Tell me no

[Bridge]
Tell me more, I would give all my time
All your words felt like a nursery rhyme
Comfortable, handin' you my whole life
When all of your words felt like a funeral rite

[Chorus]
So, where did you go
Amelie, Amelie, Amelie?
Where'd you go?
Or were you all in a dream
Amelie, Amelie?
I don't know, oh
Where did you go
Amelie, Amelie, Amelie?
Where'd you go?
Or were you all in a dream
Amelie, Amelie?
I don't know
So, where did you go
Amelie, Amelie, Amelie?
Where'd you go?
Or were you all in a dream
Amelie, Amelie?
I don't know, oh
Where did you go
Amelie, Amelie, Amelie?
Where'd you go?
Or were you all in a dream
Amelie, Amelie?
Tell me no


Title: American Teenager

Lyrics:
[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
I grew up under yellow light on a street
Putting too much faith into make believe
And another high school football team
(Ma, ah-ah, ah-ah)
The neighbor's brother came home in a box
But, he wanted to go, so maybe it was his fault
Another radar taken by the American dream

[Pre-Chorus]
And I feel it there
In the middle of the night
When the lights go out
And I'm all alone again

[Chorus]
Well, say what you want, but say it like you mean it
With your fist for once
A long, cold war with your kids at the front
Just give it one more day, then we're done
Done
I do what I want
I'm crying in the bleachers, and I said it was fun
I don't need anything from anyone
It's just not my year
But I'm all good

[Verse 2]
Sunday, morning
Hands over my knees in a room full of faces
I'm sorry if I seem off, I was probably wasted
(Wasted) And didn't feel so good (Didn't feel so good)
I got a head full of whiskey, but I always deliver
And Jesus, if you're listening, let me handle my liquor
And Jesus, if you're there, why do I feel alone in this room?
With you, ha

[Pre-Chorus]
And I feel it here
In the middle of the night
When the lights go out
But I'm still standing here

[Chorus]
Well, say what you want, but say it like you mean it
With your fist for once
A long, cold war with your kids at the front
Just give it one more day, then we're done
Done
I do what I want
I'm crying in the bleachers, and I said it was fun
I don't need anything from anyone
It's just not my year
But I'm all good out here
(Say what you want, but say it like you mean it)
With your fist for once
A long, cold war with your kids at the front
Just give it one more day, then we're done
(Done)
I do it for my daddy, and I do it for Dale
I'm doing what I want, damn, I'm doing it well
For me, for me, for me
For me, for me, oh

[Outro]
Ah-ah, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh
Mm


Title: And She Will Miss You

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I saw your shoes behind the line
I've seen your face a hundred times
But now only in my mind
The rest of you is left behind
You lay there passed out on the couch
Words falling from your mouth
Maybe you like to drink too much
And I could see you losing touch

[Chorus]
Please don't float too high
The sun will burn your wings
You are everything
Please, just run away
The headlights, they will catch you
Your mother, she will miss you

[Verse 2]
So we all waited in a room
Flipped a switch and watched the news
Waiting for a sign of you
Breathing was impossible to do
So we all waited for the call
And wondered if you're there at all
But no one's lips knew what to say
Hoping that you won’t fly away

[Chorus]
Please don't float too high
The sun will burn your wings
And you are everything
Please, just run away
The headlights, they will catch you
Your mother, she will miss you
Please don't float too high
The sun will burn your wings
You are everything
Please, just run away
The headlights, they will catch you
Your mother, she will miss you


Title: Augusta

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Feel like maybe I might go to Boston
Cut my hair in the way that I've wanted
Change my number and bury my wallet
California makes me exhausted

[Chorus]
I'm lost
I'm lost

[Verse 2]
Heard a poem about mid-October
How the leaves in the fall feel like closure
About a girl that the guy wasn't over
Think that I might relate when I'm older

[Chorus]
I'm lost
I'm lost
I'm lost
I'm lost

[Verse 3]
Tough, I don't know a lot that could hurt me
Learned the hard way to forget my body
'Til you're walking around like a zombie
Still don't know how to talk through that story

[Chorus]
I'm lost
I'm lost
I'm lost
I'm lost


Title: Barbies*

Lyrics:
[Lyrics From Snippet]
Late to the party, all of the barbies
Dripping in plastic


Title: Barely Breathing

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Time's gone, hiding
I'm lost, I'm wishing you'd come back to me
Wishing you'd come back to me
Talking, screaming, calling back to bed
I'm in your arms, in your arms
Mindless dreaming, coffee steaming
Nothing's good when you're not here

[Chorus]
And I wonder why you coming?
Why you stay, just to leave me?
Wonder why we're falling in and out of love
I need him
All my senses numb, dead and gone
I'm barely breathing

[Verse 2]
Tired of hoping, wondering emotion,
Grab my hand and hold it tight
And I'm pacing back and forth
And I'm missing what we were
And I'm wondering if the fight was worth it

[Chorus]
And I wonder why you coming?
And why you stay, just to leave me?
Wonder why we're falling in and out of love
I need him
All my senses numb, dead and gone
I'm barely breathing

[Outro]
And I wonder why you coming?
And why you stay, just to leave me?
Wonder why we're falling in and out of love
I need him
All my senses numb, dead and gone
I'm barely breathing


Title: Beach Boy (Snippet)

Lyrics:
[Verse]
When you're out [?] the lucky one
Didn't know that you're leaving
Don't you lock when you're fleeing
I'd rather not [?] your ideas
Only home 'til your coffee wants
But don't hurry the spirit
Once a time, put it down
And you're here on the beach
And the clocks ticking


Title: Benz

Lyrics:
[Chorus]
I miss you, yeah, I kinda miss you
You're never picking up, oh, that's the issue
You're just kicking it with old friends
Got you in a new Benz, saying how you're just friends

[Verse 1]
I just don't buy it, you're so used to lying
I tell you I'm fine, but I'm not
Why can't we try it? 'Cause I swear I'm dying
Admit that I want you up front
Want you up front
Admit that I want you

[Verse 2]
Maybe it's the way I think about you when I can't sleep
Maybe it's the reason that I play a song on repeat
Either way, I hear your name whenever there's a heartbeat
Whenever there's a hеartbeat
I know you're screaming
But, baby, I can't spеak up
I can't speak up, baby, I can't

[Chorus]
I miss you, yeah, I kinda miss you
You're never picking up, oh, that's the issue
You're just kicking it with old friends
Got you in a new Benz, saying how you're just friends

[Verse 3]
You just won't listen
You say that you're different from me, but I'm sure that you're not
And we've grown so distant
I'm done reminiscing so, baby, let's fall back in love
Fall back in love, baby, let's fall

[Chorus]
I miss you, yeah, I kinda miss you
You're never picking up, oh, that's the issue
You're just kicking it with old friends
Got you in a new Benz, saying how you're just friends
I miss you, yeah, I kinda miss you
You're never picking up, oh, that's the issue
You're just kicking it with old friends
Got you in a new Benz, saying how you're just friends


Title: Best

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I was bored out my mind
Lost my whole appetite
When I could come to life, I didn't
You were there all the time
You're the worst of my crimes
You fell hard, I thought "good riddance"

[Chorus]
I never was the best to you
I never was the best to you
I never was, I never was

[Verse 2]
Used to lie to your face
Twenty times in a day
It was my little strange addiction
But you still tried to stay
While I'd self-isolate
And I knew, but I stayed hidden

[Chorus]
I never was the best to you
I never was the best to you
I never was, I never was
I never was the best to you
I never was the best to you
I never was, I never was

[Bridge]
And I destroyed every silver linin' you had in your head
All of your feelings, I played with them
Go ahead, we can just call it conditionin'
We were too different, you were so sensitive
Gave me the best of that, I was so negligent
Now, I feel terrible 'bout how I handled it
And now, I, now I bet you resent
All of me, all of it, angry, blocking me over the internet
Promise I don't forget all of my fault in this
'Cause look at me, I'm alone, sitting here, stayin' home
All of my self control kinda got difficult
But I deserve it though, I deserve it though

[Pre-Chorus]
You were there all the time
You're the worst of my crimes
You fell hard, I thought "good riddance"

[Chorus]
I never was the best to you
I never was the best to you
I never was, I never was
Oh, I never was the best to you
I never was the best to you
I never was, I never was


Title: Better

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Don't feel it all, talk slow and leveled
Foot off the pedal
Same shirt and perfume on
The two of us were accidental
But so good together
Now all I feel is

[Pre-Chorus 1]
So bad about it
I barely left my bed
We talk around it, all for nothing

[Chorus]
So if that’s all it was
If you're good giving in, giving up, I hope
So if that's all it was
Hope you feel better now
And if that’s what you want
If you don't wanna see me at all now
So if that's all it was
Hope you feel better

[Verse 2]
It's been a while
Old clothes fit larger
You're looking smaller
What happened when I left?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm not mad about it
But you've barely left my head
We talk around it, all for nothing

[Chorus]
So if that's all it was
If you’re good giving in, giving up, I hope
So if that’s all it was
Hope you feel better now
And if that's what you want
If you don’t wanna see me at all now
So if that's all it was
Hope you feel better

[Bridge]
I'd turn the car around if you'd let me
If you’d let me, you'd let me, you know
I'd cry my eyes out 'til I'm empty
'Til I'm empty, I'm empty, oh

[Chorus]
So if that's all it was
If you're good giving in, giving up, I hope
So if that's all it was
Hope you feel better now
And if that's what you want
If you don't wanna see me at all now
So if that's all it was
Hope you feel better now

[Outro]
Hope you feel better now
Hope you feel better


Title: Block me out

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I'll say whatever you want, but I've become such a liar
I used to follow my gut, but now I'm just gettin' higher
It's been a couple of months since I turned to something violent
I should be happier now, so why do I feel this quiet?

[Chorus]
Now I only let me down
When there's no one else around
I've been thinkin' way too loud
I wish that I could block me out
I wish that I could block me out, out

[Verse 2]
I think I'm burnin' alive, but nobody sees the fire
'Cause when I open my mouth, I seem to be stuck in silence
And I thought of leavin' tonight, but I couldn't drive this tired
Plus, after all this time, I should be a pretty crier

[Chorus]
And now I only let me down
When there's no one else around
I've been thinkin' way too loud
I wish that I could block me out
Don't know how they see me now
Feelin' lost in every crowd
I feel ten feet off the ground
I wish that I could block me out

[Bridge]
And in my head, I make a mess of it
I'm gettin' tired of feelin' delicate
I look around to find it desolate
I used to try, but nothing's helpin' it
And in my head, I make a mess of it
I'm gettin' tired of feelin' delicate
I look around to find it desolate
I used to try, but nothing's helpin' it
Mmm

[Verse 3]
Wish I were heavier now, I'm floatin' outside my body
It's not their fault, but I've found that none of my friends will call me
Until I'm left to myself, it's honestly kind of funny
How every voice in my head is tryin' its best to haunt me

[Chorus]
'Cause now I only let me down
When there's no one else around
I've been thinkin' way too loud
I wish that I could block me out
Don't know how they see me now
Feelin' lost in every crowd
I feel ten feet off the ground
I wish that I could block me out, out, out
I wish that I could block me out, mmm
I wish that I could block me out


Title: Blowing Smoke

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I cut the rope and you fell from the tower
I let it go for my peace of mind
Bit the bullet, it didn't hurt
But I still hate the image of you kissing her
I chalk it up to "it's all for the better"

[Pre-Chorus]
And I bet you're at her place right now
You're taking off your shoes, she's lying down

[Chorus]
Tell me, is she prettier than she was on the internet?
Are your conversations cool? Like, are you even interested?
I know what you arе, brighter than the stars
Tell mе if she takes you far
Far enough away from all the baggage you've been carrying
Up another hill to all the girls who'll help you bury it
They're just blowing smoke
I'll say what they won't
I know everything they don't

[Verse 2]
I hear your voice like a boom in my tower
I sleep alone, I'm completely fine (Mm)
And you look stupid going out
If she's got a pulse, she meets your standards now
You feel nothing, and yet you still let her
[Pre-Chorus]
But I bet you're at her place right now
You couldn't point her out in any crowd

[Chorus]
Tell me, is she prettier than she was on the internet?
Are your conversations cool? Like, are you even interested?
I know what you are, brighter than the stars
Tell me if she takes you far
Far enough away from all the baggage you've been carrying
Up another hill to all the girls who'll help you bury it
They're just blowing smoke
I'll say what they won't
I know everything they don't

[Bridge]
And I find your books pretentious now
At the time, they'd fed the fantasy
I was so impressed at your hotel
Took a drag and read aloud to me
And you knew my last love let me down
It was your one perfect opening
And I bet you think about me now
When you should be sleeping

[Chorus]
But tell me, is she prettier than she was on the internet?
Are your conversations cool? Like, are you even interested?
I know what you are, brighter than the stars
Tell me if she takes you far
Far enough away from all the baggage you've been carrying
Up another hill to all the girls who'll help you bury it
They're just blowing smoke (Smoke)
I'll say what they won't (Won't)
I know everything (Thing) they don't (Don't)
(Hey, hey, hey)

[Outro]
And I know, I know, I know, I know
And I know, I know, I— (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
And I know, I know, I know, I know
And I know, I— (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
And I know, I know, I know, I know
And I know, I know, I— (Hey, hey, hey)
And I know, I know, I know, I know
And I know, I—


Title: Blue

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Maybe the beach could be our place if it is raining
I know you don't like the cold, but I do
And maybe winter's sooner than anticipated
I know you don't love the snow, but I love you

[Verse 2]
And maybe it's harder to let go than we wanted
I needed to hold on longer to you
And maybe it's ghosts from your past that keep haunting us
But maybe it's better if you see them through

[Chorus]
But, ooh
Oh, you stop the car to wake me up and I feel silent and I'm through
And you walk me home, but I feel alone after miles of this
Blue sky, it's hanging over but I'm alright and maybe one day I'll be fine instead of
Blue skies 'cause I feel like a storm tonight and blue don't feel right

[Verse 3]
And maybe there's better things than what you want in New York
I want you to let me change your mind and stay
And maybe if you could read my mind, you'd see it's killing me
And maybe I'd be better off that way

[Chorus]
But, ooh
You still stop the car to wake me up and I feel silent and I'm through
And you walk me home, but I feel alone after miles of this
Blue sky, it's hanging over but I'm alright and maybe one day I'll be fine instead of
Blue skies 'cause I feel like a storm tonight and blue don't feel right

[Outro]
Blue skies
Blue sky, mm
Blue sky, mm


Title: Breaking Me Down

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I'm so numb
If you cut my arm off, I wouldn't know
Lately I'm scared of myself, I don't show it
I don't show it

[Verse 2]
What are drugs, if not a bump in the road?
I've become restless
I tend not to sleep anymore, but
Anymore, but

[Chorus]
I guess I'm the problem if I'm always hurtin'
Scared what I'd find If I pull back the curtain
Mom said to Dad that she hopes that I figure it out
'Cause I'm older now
Breakin' me down

[Verse 3]
And I'm wrong a lot
Still so defensive, it's what I've become
'Til I neglect all the ones that I love
All the ones I love

[Verse 4]
And I've noticed a pattern of everyone leavin'
Happens when I open up with my feelings
Took me a while, but I think that I'm over it now
I don't know how
Breakin' me—

[Chorus]
Hate to admit, but I like taller buildings
And big open spaces without any ceilings
But I can't imagine myself having figured it out
'Cause I'm older now
I'm breakin' me down

[Outro]
Breakin' me down
Breakin' me down
Breakin' me down
Breakin' me down


Title: Broken Love (Snippet)

Lyrics:
[Verse]
I built this castle for the two of us
Motel room with the neon lights
Sleep talking but I don't mind
I pulled the trigger, but my hands are tied
Or raise the flag for this broken love
I’m going crazy call hotline
The window shattered but we'll fix it up
I see your eyes every time I close mine

[Chorus]
Where's the knife I wanna cut these split ends off
Drink all night, forget we never fell in love
I’m alright if you are with this situation


Title: Brush Fire

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Started as a simple lie, thinking love had chose us
We would talk into the night and nobody noticed
And I held on to every word
Couldn't let you go and called it hope
Now I’m so low, I can't ignore
We only ever made it worse

[Chorus]
Then we become a brush fire, burnin' all the pain
How can we survive a desert without rain?
And all along, your promise is that you’re changin'
Boy, you know what to say, before I turn away
Your words hit me like a hard rain in LA

[Verse 2]
Scared to turn and look behind, think I'd see you hurtin'
And even when I close my eyes, I feel like the burden (Oh)
But I'm not yours anymore
Everything you broke is ash and smoke
Now I'm so low, I can't ignore
We only ever made it worse

[Chorus]
Then we become a brush fire, burnin' all the pain
How can we survive a desert without rain?
And all along, your promise is that you’re changin’
Boy, you know what to say, before I turn away
Your words hit me like a hard rain in LA

[Bridge]
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm

[Chorus]
We become a brush fire, burnin' all the pain
How can we survive a desert without rain?
And all along, your promise is that you’re changin'
Boy, you know what to say, before I turn away
Your words hit me like a hard rain in LA


Title: Call Me Crazy (Snippet)

Lyrics:
[Verse]
They call me crazy
They write it backwards
They complicate me saying all of the wrong words
But maybe it's unfair for me to go and blame you
I can't stop thinking that I maybe kinda got to
I wanna slow down read of all that I've written
They rip my heart out, them, don't even listen
Well maybe it's unfair for me to say I hate you
But now I'm thinking that I maybe kinda got to
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, I-I-I
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Nah nah, nah nah


Title: Camden

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I never said it, but I know that I
Can't picture anything past twenty-five
Not like I care to know the timing
Not like I'm looking for that silence
Self diagnosing 'til I'm borderline
I'll do whatever helps to sleep at night
Until I'm feeling like an island
Until I'm strong enough to hide it
What was I thinking looking for a sign?
As if I've ever seen the stars align
Somebody take over the driving
Somebody notice how I'm trying
Somebody notice how I'm trying

[Chorus]
When I'm toeing that line all of the time
Calling it fine, calling it fine
Toeing that line all of the timе
Calling it fine, calling it fine

[Verse 2]
How do you call it when you'rе in your head?
Like when you really keep inside of it?
I only talk into the mirror
I'm only scared of getting bigger
At least I'll never turn to cigarettes
My brother shielded me from all of that
He said that smoking was a killer
He said he knows that I've been bitter
Maybe I'm waiting for the "go ahead"
The validation that I never get
Most of the game is unfamiliar
Most of the girls are getting thinner

[Chorus]
Toeing that line all of the time
Calling it fine, calling it fine
Toein' that line all of the time
Calling it fine, calling it fine

[Bridge]
All of me, a wound to close
But I leave the whole thing open
I just wanted you to know
I was never good at coping
All of me, a wound to close
But I leave the whole thing open
I just wanted you to know
I was never good at coping
All of me, a wound to close
But I leave the whole thing open
I just wanted you to know
I was never good at coping
All of me, a wound to close
But I leave the whole thing open
I just wanted you to know
I was never good at coping

[Outro]
I never said it but I know that I
Can't picture anything past twenty-five
Not like I care to know the timing
Not like I'm looking for that silence
I never said it but I know that I
I bury baggage 'til it's out of sight
I think it's better if I hide it
I really hope that I survive this


Title: Can’t Get Enough Of You

Lyrics:
[Verse]
We broke up a month ago
I still sleep in all your clothes
Friends still think I'm crazy and I know that
I'm no good at self control
Still here waiting on my phone, but
You'll never call and I think I know that

[Pre-Chorus]
And here we go again, you fucked me up, oh
And I can't never seem to get enough of you, enough of you


Title: Can’t Let It Go (Snippet)

Lyrics:
[Verse]
You keep going back to her
Don't remember solid ground
Maybe I could drink this down
Maybe I should block you out again
You keep going back to her
Even when it's 2 am
Kinda wish that you would hear me
I kinda think that we should call us friends

[Chorus]
And now she's in your clothes
And all up in your phone
I can't let it go, I can't let it go
I can't let it go, I can't let it go
Pretend like you don't know
I've been through this before
I can't let it go, I can't let it go
I can't let it go, I can't let it go


Title: Cedar

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
It's been good to know ya
This goodbye felt worst of all
No defining closure
No instruction manual
If you thought to call me
I would answer every time
Breaking up is funny
I forget you aren't mine

[Refrain]
I forget you aren't mine
I forget you aren't mine
I forget you aren't mine

[Chorus]
It's impossible to acclimate
Every time we talk, we understate
How I know we both could die
We both could die
But you told me that you felt the same
When I told you how I needed space
But I think it was a lie
It was a liе

[Verse 2]
It's been tough to leave you
Every еmpty Sunday night
You come back in pieces
Every detail amplified
If you think to write me
It'll go internalized
Breaking up is funny
I forget you aren't mine

[Refrain]
I forget you aren't mine

[Chorus]
It's impossible to acclimate
Every time we talk, we understate
How I know we both could die
We both could die
But you told me that you felt the same
When I told you how I needed space
But I think it was a lie
It was a lie

[Bridge]
And it's wild how it dissipates
How you're further from me every day
This could be the worst goodbye
The worst goodbye
I don't even know what's left to say
'Cause we called it back then anyway
Could you just remind me why?
Remind me why

[Verse 3]
It's been weird to miss you
Hits me at the strangest times
Seven years would cut through
Other people like a knife
If I tried to meet you
Couldn't look you in the eye
Breaking up is funny
I forget you aren't mine

[Outro]
I forget you aren't mine


Title: Close To You

Lyrics:
[Intro]
(Close to you)
(Close to you)

[Verse 1]
I don't got a single problem with provocative
See the bodies, how they burn, it's just the way it is
Smoky, dark, crowded room, I need nothing
Under pink light in June (Ahh)
I was so cool, but then, all of a sudden
You saw me look at you

[Pre-Chorus]
I burn for you
And you don't even know my name
If you asked me to
I'd give up everything

[Chorus]
To be close to you
Pull the trigger on the gun I gave you when we met
I wanna be close to you
Break my heart and start a fire, you got me overnight
Just let me be

[Post-Chorus]
Close to you, close to you, close to you
(Just let me be) Oh, close to you, close to you, close to you

[Verse 2]
And now your mouth is moving, cinematic timing
You pull me in and touch my neck, and now I'm dying
You should be mine for life, I'll be signing
Every dotted line (Ahh)
Chemical override, ultraviolet
You could be mine tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
And I burn for you
And you don't even know my name
If you asked me to
I'd give you everything

[Chorus]
To be close to you
Pull the trigger on the gun I gave you when we met
I wanna be close to you
Break my heart and start a fire, you got me overnight
Just let me be

[Post-Chorus]
Close to you, close to you, close to you
(Just let me be) Oh, close to you, close to you, close to you

[Bridge]
I burn for you
Mm

[Chorus]
To be close to you
Pull the trigger on the gun I gave you when we met
I wanna be close to you
Break my heart and start a fire, you got me overnight
Just let me be

[Post-Chorus]
Close to you (To you), close to you (To you)
Close to you (To you, just let me be close)
Oh, close to you (Ooh), close to you (To you)
Close to you (Just let me be)
Oh, close to you (Ahh), close to you (Ahh)
Close to you (Just let me be)

[Outro]
Oh, close to you, close to you
Close to you


Title: Cold

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I'm in the back of your head but it's dumb
You think I'm everything I'm not
And we keep calling it off and back on
I don't know anything you want now

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't tell your friends, they'll make it worse
Can we just delete the words that made it worse
And let the water settle?
Don't be so damn cold

[Chorus]
I only lie when I say I'm alright
High on the hills of the carpet floor
How does it feel to be right all the time?
I took a pill but it's still sore

[Verse 2]
I'm in the back of your car on my phone
'Cause you don't talk to me at all
And when you finally turn around
You say it wasn't my fault

[Pre-Chorus]
So tell me why, we're back and forth
I would lovе if we could talk a little more
And lеt the whole thing settle
I've almost let go

[Chorus]
I only lie when I say I'm alright
High on the hills of the carpet floor
How does it feel to be right all the time?
I took a pill but it's still sore
Lying awake when you turn off the light
Almost forgot we've been here before
How does it feel to be right all the time?
I took a pill but it's still sore


[Bridge]
You can't get me out of your head
I'm so sick of starting again
How'd you get so hard to forget?
Left a heart-shaped hole in my couch
It's too late to figure it out
Say I took the words from your mouth
'Cause it always sounds like

[Chorus]
I only lie when I say I'm alright
High on the hills of the carpet floor
How does it feel to be right all the time?
I took a pill but it's still sore (Still sore)
Lying awake when you turn off the light
Almost forgot we've been here before
How does it feel to be right all the time? (All the time)
I took a pill but it's still sore


Title: Cold Coffee (Snippet)

Lyrics:
[Verse]
New York
That night was the first time I saw you
I walked to the door of your house to surprise you
[?]
Princess took a gun to her bedroom
Ran out
The lies that I used to tell you
Cold coffee
Leave a note by the door in the ash tray
You're still talking like we never decided to change
Come over
Call me back at 4 in the morning
I love you
But hate that you don’t even know it


Title: Deep red

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Drag me back again, pull me under
I can feel you watching me
And I make this same mistakes I made last summer
'Cause when you’re around, I find it hard to breathe

[Pre-Chorus]
And you knock on my door, late at night
I'll always let you in
You're poisonous, but I don’t care
I feel you on my skin

[Chorus]
Our love is deep red, bleeding, hungry for more
Our love is hopeless
Craving a hundred of you more
Our love is deep red, deep red, deep red

[Verse 2]
Seven months of being sober
I still smell you on my sheets (Smell you on my sheets)
And I thought it would be easy to get over you
But I’m still in between, give me that sweet release

[Chorus]
'Cause our love is deep red, bleeding, hungry for more
Our love is hopeless
Craving a hundred of you more
Our love is deep red, deep red, deep red

[Pre-Chorus]
And you knock on my door, late at night
I'll always let you in
You're poisonous, but I don’t care
I feel you on my skin

[Chorus]
Our love is deep red, bleeding, hungry for more
Our love is hopeless
Craving a hundred of you more
Our love is deep red, bleeding, hungry for more
Our love is hopeless
Craving a hundred of you more
Our love is deep red, bleeding, hungry for more
Our love is hopeless
Craving a hundred of you more
Our love is deep red, deep red, deep red


Title: Difficult

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
My double vision
Is only amplifyin' everythin' he isn't
'Til I feel less attached and bored to death, but listen
It's no one's fault, it's just my terrible condition, mm
And I've been thinkin'
If I move out this year, I'll feel my parents slippin'
Away and also, I'm just scared of that commitment
I really think sometimes there's somethin' that I'm missin', mm

[Chorus]
Oh, I know
Spiralin' is miserable
I should probably go back home
Why does that feel difficult, difficult?
And oh, I hope
I wake up invisible
I'd be someone no one knows
I guess I'm just difficult

[Verse 2]
To name this feelin'
Would take a hundred thousand years, some kind of grievin'
But over what I never had, so I've been speakin'
To my therapist, I call her every weekend, mm
I meant to tell you
How I've hated how we left things when it fell through
'Cause you were everythin' to me, where did you run to?
Was it somethin' that I said that colored you blue? Mm

[Chorus]
Oh, I know
Spiralin' is miserable
I should probably go back home
Why does that feel difficult, difficult?
And oh, I hope
I wake up invisible
I'd be someone no one knows
I guess I'm just difficult, difficult

[Post-Chorus]
Difficult (I)
Difficult

[Bridge]
I've been drinkin'
And stayin' up too late, relivin' bad decisions
I thought eventually, my ranting here would fix it
I really think sometimes there's somethin' that I'm missin' (Mm)

[Chorus]
Oh, I know
Spiralin' is miserable
I should probably go back home
Why does that feel difficult, difficult?
And oh, I hope
I wake up invisible
I'd be someone no one knows
I guess I'm just difficult, difficult
Oh, I know
Spiralin' is miserable
I should probably go back home
Why does that feel difficult, difficult?
And oh, I hope
I wake up invisible
I'd be someone no one knows
I guess I'm just difficult, difficult


Title: Do I Know U

Lyrics:
[Intro: Gracie Abrams]
I saw your shoes behind the line
I’ve seen your face a hundred times
But now only in my mind
The rest of you is left behind
You lay there passed out on the couch
Words falling from your mouth
Maybe you like to drink too much
I could see you losing touch

[Hook: Yung Vex and Both]
Please don’t look to happy there
With him, don’t look in love
'Cus you were everything
Please don’t, run away
I’m so scared to text you
But, your love hurts me, and I, miss you

[Verse 1: Yung Vex]
I don’t fucking hate you
I’m scared to send a text
Do I regret decisions or do I only want the sex
Don’t ask me why I left
'Cus I don't know why I left
I don’t use my head
Your not mine, but I wish you were again
You think I didn’t care bitch it hurt to end
I want you back, but do I want you back?
I don’t know but I want to know very bad
I'm sorry baby do you want us back

[Verse 2: Yung Vex]
I just be looking at your pictures
Makes me fucking miss you
You were mine now we strangers
When my friends ask about you I say I hate her
My girl text I’ll text her later
But everytime I fall in love I’m still in love with someone else
I’ll admit I need help
With my health
But I’m going crazy
I’m going crazy, I’m going crazy

[Hook: Yung Vex, Both and Gracie Abrams]
Please don’t look to happy there
With him, don’t look in love
'Cus you were everything
Please don’t, run away
I’m so scared to text you
But, your love hurts me, and I, miss you
Please don’t look to happy there
With him, don’t look in love
'Cus you were everything
Please don’t, run away
I’m so scared to text you
But, your love hurts me, and I, miss you
Please don’t float too high
The sun will burn your wings
You are everything
Please just run away
The headlights they will catch you
Your mother she will miss you


Title: Don’t Owe You Anything*

Lyrics:
Lyrics From Live Stream Snippet


Make me pretty, if you could
Give me something that'll work
'Cause I don't wanna go to bed like this
I don't wanna wake up
Say you're different, but you're not
Took my body, in the dark
You would think that I'm in love with it
But I wanna break up

I am sick now
I break down
And you're miles away
I have many words that I could say
But I just know I hate this place
If it's where you are


And then if I could change, I'd tell myself to be okay
That I don't owe you anything
That you're not worth the scars


Title: Edge

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Hold me tight, I am swallowed by your dark brown eyes
I am lost again
A kiss goodnight isn't half as right
If you're not by my side
I will try to pretend

[Chorus]
Like you're not going anywhere
Like you're not going anywhere
Like you're not going anywhere
Oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Sing to sleep, you are all I need
Just your company, and the start of a smile
But I will lay with you, under skies of blue
Crashing over you, I will stay, all night

[Chorus]
Just don't go anywhere
Don't you go anywhere
Please don't go anywhere
Mmm-mmm-mmm

[Bridge]
I'm living like I'm gonna lose you
Like I'm gonna lose you
Oh, I see right through it
I'm living like I'm on the edge
Like I'm on the edge
Life in bitterness, oh

[Chorus]
Just don't go anywhere
Please don't go anywhere
Just don't go anywhere
Oh-oh-mmm, mmm-mmm
Just don't go anywhere
Don't go anywhere
Just don't go anywhere
Mmm-mmm


Title: Eighteen (Snippet)

Lyrics:
[Verse]
It's been a while, since i felt right 
Another drink, another night
It's been a while
I'm waking up here and I'm eighteen
And I'm crazy in love with you
Maybe if i play it right I'll stay here
I don't write anymore about boys but
I'm in love with New York


Title: Enough

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I'll only let you down for a minute
Can't tell you my heart's really in it
And love will tears us apart 'til we finish
Cut deeper in torts scars, I'm sick of living with
Cold angry marks, about how I messed up
Punch a hole trough the wall 'cause I'm so messed up
Wandered into the dark without religion
Pull my hands to your mouth like you've been missing me

[Verse 2]
I'll only make you think for a second
Can't count all the nights you left me begging for
Something worth my time, like how we left it
You threw it away, oh, I'm just guessing 'cause
I remember the time when you messed up
Called me, wanting it back but you messed up
It's hard to pick up a hundred broken pieces
I'm thinking it's best if we just leave 'em there

[Chorus]
I don't want to know about her
Please leave me alone
I've crumbled once before
You've done enough, but not enough
Oh

[Verse 3]
I'll only make you wait 'cause it matters
Do you care at all that I'm shattered?
When you've got it figured out
Yeah, you had her in the palm of your hand
It doesn't matter, but
You left me alone when I was messed up
Never picked up the phone and you're so messed up
It's like I'm going insane for the better
Pleased to giving me something to remember you by

[Chorus]
And I don't want to know about her
Please leave me alone
I've crumbled once before
You've done enough, but not enough
Oh

[Outro]
I don't want to know about her
Please leave me alone
I've crumbled once before
You've done enough, but not enough
Enough, enough


Title: Everywhere, Everything

Lyrics:
[Intro: Noah Kahan]
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
It's been a long year

[Verse 1: Noah Kahan]
Would we survive in a horror movie?
I doubt it, we're too slow moving
We trust everyone we meet
Two bodies riddled with scars from our pre-teens
Intertwine in a car's dirty backseat
And stare at a drive-in screen

[Pre-Chorus: Noah Kahan]
We didn't know that the sun was collapsing
'Til the seas rose and the buildings came crashing
We cried, "Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh"

[Chorus: Noah Kahan]
Everywhere, everything, I wanna love you
'Til we're food for the worms to eat
'Til our fingers decompose, keep my hands in yours
Everywhеre, everything, I wanna lovе you
'Til we're food for the worms to eat
'Til our fingers decompose, keep my hands in yours

[Verse 2: Gracie Abrams]
Mm-hm-mm
Drive slowly, I know every route in this county
And maybe that ain't such a bad thing
I'll tell you where not to speed
And it's been a long year
And all of our book's pages dog-eared
We write out the ends on our palms, dear
Then forget to read

[Pre-Chorus: Gracie Abrams]
And we couldn't know that the sun was collapsing
Until the seas rose and the buildings came crashing
We cried, "Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh"

[Chorus: Noah Kahan & Gracie Abrams]
Everywhere, everything, I wanna love you
'Til we're food for the worms to eat
'Til our fingers decompose, keep my hand in yours
Everywhere, everything, I wanna love you
'Til we're food for the worms to eat
'Til our fingers decompose, keep my hand in yours

[Post-Chorus: Gracie Abrams, Noah Kahan]
Ah-ah, ah, ah
Ah-ah (Ah)
Ah-ah (Ah)
Ah-ah (Ah, ah-oh)
Ah-ah (Ah-oh)
Ah-ah (Ah, ah-oh)

[Chorus: Noah Kahan & Gracie Abrams, Gracie Abrams]
Everywhere, everything, I wanna love you
'Til we're food for the worms to eat
'Til our fingers decompose
I'll keep my hands in yours


Title: Fault line

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
You could go and I won't even feel it
Wouldn't hold up the road when you're leavin'
You're a bad holiday, you're the drug that I take
When I want to forget how I'm feelin'

[Chorus]
I know you're a fault line, but I'll break too
Crackin' at the same time, does it shock you?
When I'm down, I fall right back to you, it happens
I know you're a fault line, but I'll break too
I'll break too

[Verse 2]
You could go and I bet I'd recover overnight
Finish hurtin' each other
You feel lightyears away
If I met you today, I would run to the arms of another

[Chorus]
I know you're a fault line, but I'll break too
Crackin' at the same time, does it shock you?
Whеn I'm down, I fall back into you, it happens
I know you're a fault line, but I'll brеak too
I'll break too

[Bridge]
And all of my imaginary friends are scared of you
I've gone and cried to them in our bedroom
Most nights, I will pretend I left this sooner

[Chorus]
But I know you're a fault line, but I'll break too
Crackin' at the same time, does it shock you?
When I'm down, I fall back into you, it happens
I know you're a fault line, but I'll break too, mm
I'll break too

[Outro]
I will break too
I'd break too, mm


Title: Feel Her Interlude

Lyrics:
None


Title: Feel Her On Your Body

Lyrics:
[Verse]
I can feel it on my tongue when you kiss me like that
Know you miss her like that
Though I don't got what she had
I can feel her on your body
Running through your mind
[?] you wanting it back
[?] need her like that
Though I don’t have what she has

[Chorus]
I can feel her on your body
Feel her on your body
Body, body
I can feel her on your body
Body, body
I can feel her on your body
Body, body
Feel her on your body
Body


Title: Feels Like

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Oh, we almost got away, we've cut it close
The city's getting loud
If I choke, it's only 'cause I'm scared to be alone
Been trying to work it out, you should know

[Chorus]
I would do whatever you wanted
We don't have to leave the apartment (Ah)
Met you at the right time (Ah)
This is what it feels like
Living in a movie I've watched and
Funny, 'cause you couldn't have called it (Ah)
Met you at the right time (Ah)
This is what it feels like

[Verse 2]
Oh, the train was cold, we left Connecticut
We stayed a couple hours
Our clothes matched enough to throw me off a bit
Your phone was playing "Towers" and I

[Chorus]
I would do whatever you wanted
We don't have to leave the apartment (Ah)
Met you at the right time (Ah)
This is what it feels like
Living in a movie I've watched and
Funny, 'cause you couldn't have called it (Ah)
Met you at the right time (Ah)
This is what it feels like

[Bridge]
And I need you sometimes
We'll be alright (Ah)
Met you at the right time (Ah)
This is what it feels like
And I miss you some nights
We'll be alright (Ah)
Met you at the right time (Ah)
This is what it feels like

[Outro]
I would do whatever you wanted
We don't have to leave the apartment
Met you at the right time
This is what it feels like


Title: Felt Good About You

Lyrics:
[Chorus]
I felt good about you 'til I didn't
Crossed lines, past lives, clear vision
Felt good about you, felt good about you
Felt good about you 'til I didn't
Surefire trainwreck omission
Felt good about you, felt good about you

[Verse 1]
Got what you demanded, picture perfect like you planned it
Can't believe the way we landed, fallin' through
Held my breath for your reaction like the first time that we happened
We were fightin' more than laughin', black and blue, mm

[Chorus]
Felt good about you 'til I didn't
Fell hard, thеn I lost your interest
Felt good about you, fеlt good about you
Felt good about you 'til I didn't
Bad nights, new girls, misgivings
Felt good about you, felt good about you

[Verse 2]
Got me where you want me, in your palm, it's almost funny
All my friends, they tried to stop me wanting you
But I was never meant to listen, not until I found a reason
It took all of me to walk away and choose

[Refrain]
Felt good about you, you, you
Felt good about you, you, you
Felt good about you, you, you, mm
Felt good about you, felt good about you

[Chorus]
I felt good about you 'til I didn't
Fought hard through premonitions
Felt good about you, felt good about you
Felt good about you 'til I didn't
You felt nice for a bad decision
Felt good about you, felt good about you

[Bridge]
Really got me thinkin', future plannin' for no reason
There were nights I skipped out sleepin' 'cause of you
And I had less than half of somethin', what you gave was what I wanted
'Til I realized I felt fuller without you, mm

[Outro]
Felt good about you 'til I didn't
I felt good about you


Title: For Real This Time

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I think that maybe I was right
Back when I knew to draw the line
Already gave what I could offer
Maybe we'll work another time
I guess the thought of it's enough
No going back or switchin' up
I really wish that I could do that
Walking away from you is tough

[Pre-Chorus]
I know we've run it dry
I've heard that happens sometimes
I shouldn't be surprised, should I?

[Chorus]
I've packed my bags in the middle of the night
A thousand times, I got up to say goodbye
I could be wrong, but I think that I'm for real this time
I've taken down all the pictures in my room
I've hidden things that reminded me of you
I know I've lied, but I think that I'm for real this time

[Verse 2]
Couldn't you tell when I was off?
You never asked me what it was
I kind of hope you feel the same way
So that I'm not the only one

[Pre-Chorus]
Who thinks we've run it dry?
But still we've stayed a long time
I'm sorry if I make you cry tonight

[Chorus]
'Cause I've packed my bags in the middle of the night
A thousand times, I got up to say goodbye
I could be wrong, but I think that I'm for real this time
I've taken down all the pictures in my room
I've hidden things that reminded me of you
I know I've lied, but I think that I'm for real this time

[Bridge]
I know that I've lied
But we're running dry
Know I won't come back this time
I know that I've lied
But we're runnin' dry
Think that I'm for real this time

[Outro]
I've packed my bags in the middle of the night
A thousand times, I got up to say goodbye
I could be wrong, but I think that I'm for real this time


Title: Free Now

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
This isn't what you want, it's only how you feel
You openly admit you're far away from healing
And I hate to pull the plug, but I think I get your deal
I finally know better than to wait for you back here

[Chorus]
And I hope you know I don't think
You're a bad guy, that you're damaged
Took you two months, only two to raise the bar
You're the saddest, but a good kid
Almost loved you, but I didn't
I could laugh now, how we tried to play those parts

[Verse 2]
I know that you're removed, I can feel it when we talk
You start to let me in, but then you shut it off
And it's half of you that hurts sometimes, the half that I don't get
I swear that I'm not mad at you, but I can't share your bed now

[Chorus]
And I can imagine, when you go home
Does she follow like an echo?
Like your shadow, you can try, but you can't run
From the truth of what you both made
That you blew up on a Tuesday
How does pain taste when it melts into your tongue?

[Bridge]
It's a pain that I caught you at a bad time
It's a shame that I memorized your outline
You were straight up with me, you were so kind
But I knew what you knew, honey, great minds
It was harsh 'cause I lost what I wanted
I was brave when I kissed you in London
We're collateral here, man, we got hit
Hope you find somewhere safe for your baggage
Every page that I wrote, you were on it
Feel you deep in my bones, you're the current
And I showed no restraint, it was something
I was scared up 'til you made me love it

[Outro]
If you find yourself out, if there is a right time
Chances are I'll be here, we could share a lifeline
If you feel like fallin', catch me on the way down
Never been less empty, all I feel is free now
If you find yourself out, if there is a right time
Chances are I'll be here, we could share a lifeline
If you feel like fallin', catch me on the way down
Never been less empty, all I feel is free now


Title: Free (snippet)

Lyrics:
It's a pain that I caught you at a bad time
It's a shame that I memorized your outline
You were straight up with me
You were so kind
But I knew what you knew
Honey, great minds
It was harsh cause I lost what I wanted
I was brave when I kissed you in London
We're collateral here and we've got it
Hope you find somewhere safe for your baggage
Every page that I wrote, you were on it
Feel you deep in my bones, you're the current
And I showed no restraint, it was something
I was scared up til you made me love it
If you find yourself out
If there is a right time
Chances are I'll be here
We could share a lifeline
If you feel like falling
Catch me on the way down
Never been less empty
All I feel is free now


Title: Friend

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Pictures of the old us got me feelin' older
I just thought you should know I never wanted closure
But you had no problem leavin'
Now I'm the one to feel it

[Chorus]
I just can't believe you don't know what I'm feeling
Guess you got the best of this
Pickin' up the pieces, you just wanna leave 'em
Killing me a little bit
And I hate the way you love me
And I hate that I still care
Funny how you feel like we would ever talk again
How could you think I'd be your friend?

[Verse 2]
I'm sure you're doin' fine but I don't wanna hear it
And if I left my T-shirt, you can keep it
I don't wanna see you again if it's different
'Cause I'll only see all the things that I'm missin'
And I should've cut all the ties but I didn't, I didn't let go, mmm

[Chorus]
I just can't believe you don't know what I'm feeling
Guess you got the best of this (Guess you got the best of this)
Pickin' up the pieces, you just wanna leave 'em
Killing me a little bit (Killing me a little bit)
And I hate the way you love me
And I hate that I still care (I still care)
Funny how you feel like we would ever talk again
How could you think I'd be...

[Bridge]
You had no problem leavin'
Now, I'm the one to feel it

[Chorus]
I just can't believe you don't know what I'm feeling
Guess you got the best of this (Guess you got the best of this)
Pickin' up the pieces, you just wanna leave 'em
Killing me a little bit (Killing me a little bit)
And I hate the way you love me
And I hate that I still care (I still care)
So funny how you feel like we would ever talk again
How could you think I'd be your friend


Title: Full machine

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I'm a rollercoaster
You’re a dead-end street
But won't you stay for a while?
I wish that you'd never leave
I know I know better
You’re no guarantee
But if you asked me to run away
I'd go easily

[Chorus]
I almost lost it
I'll heal eventually
But faster if you're next to me, next to me
I'm codependent
But tryin' hard not to be
I'm better when you're next to me

[Verse 2]
I’m a shameless caller
You’re a full machine
But won't you answer tonight
And say somethin’ nice to me?
And you don't have to mean it
You can lie to me
But if you asked me to run away
I'd go easily

[Chorus]
I almost lost it
I'll heal eventually
But faster if you’re next to me, next to me
I'm codependent
But tryin' hard not to be
I'm better when you're next to me, next to me, oh

[Post-Chorus]
But do you think we could talk?
'Cause I've been trying to tell you
How you're the one that I turn to, mmm
But I should probably stop
Instead of forcin' a breakthrough
It's just that I'll always choose you

[Verse 3]
I'm a forest fire
You're the kerosene
I had a life here before you
But now it's burnin'
I know I know better
And you're ignorin' me
Still, if you asked me to run away
I'd go easily

[Chorus]
I almost lost it
I'll heal eventually
But faster if you're next to me, next to me
I'm codependent
But tryin' hard not to be
I'm better when you're next to me, next to me

[Post-Chorus]
Well, do you think we could talk?
'Cause I've been trying to tell you
How you're the one that I turn to (I turn to), mmm
But I should probably stop
Instead of forcin' a breakthrough
It's just that I'll always choose you


Title: Gave You I Gave You I

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
You were my worst time, you were the shoreline
You were the crash and now I break
Gave you my best days, gave you the deep pain
Gave you I, gave you I, gave you I, gave you I
Am I what you wanted? Was I self-appointed?
I slowly moved into your house
All of my dark blue, covered it for you
But I'm just so embarrassed now

[Chorus]
And you did all that I wouldn't do, erasing lines around us
I held my head, I used to hold you but now I'll walk around us
And I can't lie and claim confused when I know just what happened
You got bored and I felt usеd, now I'm all sad about it

[Verse 2]
What did I ask for that I now pay for?
Would it have killed you to explain
That you wеren't ready? And you nearly told me
And, still, I gave you I, gave you I gave you I
My honest commitment, I sat and listened
I was your floorboard, holdin' it down
You went off running away from something
That I have nothing to do with now

[Chorus]
And you did all that I'd never do, erasing time around us
I held my breath, I used to hold you but now I'll walk around us
And could you not deny the truth? 'Cause I know just what happened
You got bored and I felt used, now I'm all sad about it

[Bridge]
When did you slip through my fingers, did I ever have you?
Was I just a placeholder to fill the hole inside you?
I've been feeling sick but I should help myself, not call you
Nothing left to say 'cause you're not over her, now, are you?

[Chorus]
And you did all that I wouldn't do, erasing lines around us
I held my head, I used to hold you but now I'll walk around us
And I won't lie and claim confused when I know just what happened
You got bored and I felt used, now I'm all sad about it

[Outro]
Oh, you got bored and I felt used, now I'm all sad about it
Oh, you got bored and I felt used, now I'm all sad about it
Oh, you got bored and I felt used, now I'm so sad about it


Title: ​golden slumbers

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep, pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

[Chorus]
Golden slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles await you when you rise
Sleep, pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

[Verse 2]
Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep, pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby


Title: Good Luck Charlie

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
You keep a picture of Audrey inside of your wallet
Went for a drink and the bartender thought she was dead
He made you live out that nightmare and you nearly lost it
You made a joke and you watched it go over his head

[Pre-Chorus]
And now it all comes down to you
It all comes down to you

[Chorus]
Good luck, Charlie
I hope you're happy
This isn't what you wanted
You know that it's her or nothin'

[Verse 2]
Now when you fly over Michigan I'll bet you see her (Mm)
Right on the wing of the plane, in the lakes, in the sky (Mm)
You can go home at night and you might really not need her (Mm)
But you feel her everywhere, she is the love of your life (Mm)

[Pre-Chorus]
Now it all comes down to you

[Chorus]
Good luck, Charlie
I hope you're ready
'Cause this isn't what you wanted
You know that it's her or nothin'

[Outro]
Good luck, Charlie
I hope you're happy


Title: Hard to Sleep

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I only thought it for a minute, but it got me down
The kind of feeling when you've got something to cry about
And all the talking turned to screaming that I couldn't help
This isn't me, me, me
I only thought it for a moment but it's crippling
I guess the gravity of going out is sinking in
What if I'm missing the capacity for all of it?
This isn't me, me, me

[Chorus]
And I'm so scared of losing all control
Don't you tell me it's better to let go
When the weight of the world feels so close
It's only me, me, me

[Verse 2]
Audrey told me that she thinks it might be in my head
How I'm overthinking everything I never said
How it's killing me a little to be different, oh
It isn't me, me, me

[Chorus]
But I'm so scared of losing all control
Don't you tell me it's better to let go
When the weight of the world feels so close
It's only me, me, me

[Bridge]
Hard to sleep, could it be
Only me? Only me
Hard to sleep, could it be
Only me? Only me
Hard to sleep, could it be
Only me? Only me
Hard to sleep, could it be
Only me? Only me
Mm-mm, mm-hmm

[Outro]
I'm so scared of losing control
When they tell me it's better to let go
When the weight of the world feels so close
It's only me, me, me
And I'm so scared of losing all control
When they tell me it's better to let go
When the weight of the world is so close
It's only me (Me), me (Me), me
It's only me, me, me


Title: I’d Go Back Sometimes (Snippet)

Lyrics:
[Verse]
Now, triple vision, spinning around my [?]
Blacking out  and wasting time we [?]
I wouldn't [?]
Pick it up, pick it up

[Chorus]
I'd go back sometimes
I could try to name it, nothing but a [?]
I'd go back sometimes
Now I'm feeling fucked up, we could [?] a [?]
I could try to name it, nothing but a feeling [?] you could forgive me
I'd go back sometimes


Title: I Don’t Even Know That I’m Missing You (Snippet)

Lyrics:
[Verse]
I'm sorry, I know you're right
I broke you the other night
Can't stop seeing your eyes
Do you see mine, mine
I know that I walked away
Before I could hear you say
"I love you" from far away
Is that okay?
Maybe we should talk about it or
Maybe we should leave it unwritten
I don't even know what I'm missing here
Maybe we just should have gone over


Title: I Don’t Know How To Be Alone (Snippet)

Lyrics:
[Verse]
I left a couple things
Your bed remembers me by yourself
You're letting go of it?
I called you and you answered in silence
Got people saying things
I’m better off with him
Don't you think I know the way it ends
Come home to nothing but quiet
Time after time you walk me home
And nothing compares to how you know me
You know, you know that I don't know how to be alone
No, I don’t know how to be alone, yeah
Alone, yeah﻿, yeah


Title: If I Could Change (Snippet)

Lyrics:
[Verse]
Make me pretty if you could
Give me something that'll work
'Cause I don't want to go to bed like this
I don't want to wake up
Say you're different, but you're not
Took my body in the dark
You would think that I'm in love with it
But I want to break up
I'm sick now
I break down

[Chorus]
And you're miles away from any words that I could say
But I just know I hate this place
If it's where you are
And if I could change I would tell myself to be okay
And that I don't owe you anything
And that you're not worth the scars


Title: If You Only Knew

Lyrics:
None


Title: I kinda hate you (Snippet)

Lyrics:
[Verse]
Tried to tell me it's a miscommunication
You don't look different to me even though you're changing
I hear the rumors, yeah I hear 'em from the hallway
You don't look me in the eye so you can save face

[Chorus]
I kinda hate you, but only sometimes, no it sounds funny
We've gotten so loud from the silence over here, honey
You lie and I'm bored pretending not to care about it
Oh-oh I'm sure I won't be coming back


Title: I Kinda Miss You

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I miss you, yeah, I kinda miss you
You're never picking up, oh, that's the issue
You just kickin' it with old friends
Got you in a new Benz saying how you're just friends

[Verse 2]
I just don't buy it, you're so used to lying
I tell you I'm fine but I'm not
Why can't we try it? 'Cause I swear I'm dying
Admit that I want you up front
Want you up front
Admit that I want you up front

[Verse 3]
Well maybe it's the way I think about you when I can't sleep
Maybe it's the reason that I play a song on repeat
Either way, I hear your name whenever there's a heartbeat
I know you're screaming, baby, I can't speak up
I can't speak up
Baby, I can't speak up

[Verse 4]
But you just won't listen
You say that you're different from me
But I'm sure that you're not
We've grown so distant
I'm done reminiscing
So, baby, let's fall back in love
Fall back in love
Baby, let's fall back in love

[Chorus]
I miss you, yeah, I kinda miss you
Just can't speak up
I want you up front
I miss you, yeah, I kinda miss you
I want you up front
I want you up front


Title: I Knew It, I Know You

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I swear to God, I haven't thought of you in ages
I've lived a lot, I've loved and lost, I've let the rain in
I'm pretty sure, I mean I've heard, you never faced it
I understand, I changed your plans, I had to, baby

[Chorus]
And all I did was right by me, I heard that almost killed you
Well I knew it, I know you, I called it
And I think that you earnestly have waited on apologies
But I can't pretend that I'm sorry
When I'm not sorry

[Verse 2]
So aren't you sad about the fact that you can't write me?
I cheered the loudest for you when you won your trophiеs
I'm on the ground, how's the weathеr on your planet?
An empty house, the noise is loud, it's how you stand it

[Chorus]
And don't you feel alone at night or sorta kinda daily?
Well I knew it, I know you, I called it
And it makes me wanna cry sometimes
But don't you know the deal now?
Well I just can't pretend that I'm sorry
When I'm not sorry

[Bridge]
And we don't even know each other now
And I'd blow all my plans if you'd meet me out
We could talk, we could get it, we could both calm down
Down (Down, down)

[Verse 3]
It all changed for me and I told you (Down)
(Down, down)
You had the wrong idea about me (Down)
(Down, down)
And all I ever did was consider you (Down)
(Down, down)
Until all I could do was consider me (Down)
(Down, down, down, down)
I was your entertainment from a dark place
(Down, down, down, down)
You don't know how to step outside yourself
(Down, down, down, down)
It's not my fault you can't sit with the hard thing
(Down, down, down, down)
You really thought you would get what you wanted
(Down, down, down, down)

[Outro]
You really thought you would get what you wanted
(Down, down, down, down)
(Down, down, down, down)


Title: I know it won’t work

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I left you here
Heard you keep the extra closet empty
In case this year
I come back and stay throughout my twenties
What if I won't?
How am I supposed to put that gently?
And down the road
You will love me until you resent me, mmm

[Verse 2]
I've had the thought
Tried to work it out through anxious pacin'
What if I'm not
Worth the time and breath I know you're savin'?
But it's a lot
All the shine of half a decade fadin'
The whole facade
Seemed to fall apart, it's complicated, mmm

[Chorus]
And part of me wants to walk away 'til you really listen
I hate to look at your face and know that we're feelin' different
'Cause part of me wants you back, but
I know it won't work like that, huh?
Why won't you try movin' on for once? That might make it easy
I know we cut all the ties, but you're never really leavin'
And part of me wants you back, but
I know it won't work like that, huh?
I know it won't work like that

[Verse 3]
I'll open up
I'm thinkin' everythin' you wish I wasn't
The call was tough
But you're better off, I'm bein' honest
So, won't you stop
Holdin' out for me when I don't want it?
Just brush me off
'Cause I'm your ghost right now, your house is haunted

[Chorus]
And part of me wants to walk away 'til you really listen
I hate to look at your face and know that we're feelin' different
'Cause part of me wants you back, but
I know it won't work like that, huh?
Why won't you try movin' on for once? That might make it easy
I know we cut all the ties, but you're never really leavin'
And part of me wants you back, but
I know it won't work like that, huh?

[Bridge]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
I know it won't work like that, huh?
Oh-oh, oh-oh
I know it won't work like that, huh?

[Chorus]
And part of me wants to walk away 'til you really listen
I hate to look at your face and know that we're feelin' different
'Cause part of me wants you back, but
I know it won't work like that, huh?
Why won't you try movin' on for once? That might make it easy
I know we cut all the ties, but you're never really leavin'
And part of me wants you back, but
I know it won't work like that, huh?


Title: I Love You, I’m Sorry

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Two Augusts ago
I told the truth, oh, but you didn't like it, you went home
You're in your Benz, I'm by the gate
Now you go alone
Charm all the people you train for, you mean well but aim low
And I'll make it known like I'm getting paid

[Chorus]
That's just the way life goes
I like to slam doors closed
Trust me, I know it's always about me
I love you, I'm sorry

[Verse 2]
Two summers from now
We'll have been talking, but not all that often, we're cool now
I'll be on a boat, you're on a plane going somewhere, same
And I'll have a drink
Wistfully lean out my window and watch the sun set on the lake
I might not feel real, but it's okay, mm

[Chorus]
'Cause that's just the way life goes
I push my luck, it shows
Thankful you don't send someone to kill me
I love you, I'm sorry

[Bridge]
You were the best but you were the worst
As sick as it sounds, I loved you first
I was a dick, it is what it is
A habit to kick, the age-old curse
I tend to laugh whenever I'm sad
I stare at the crash, it actually works
Making amends, this shit never ends
I'm wrong again, wrong again
[Chorus]
The way life goes
Joyriding down our road
Lay on the horn to prove that it haunts me
(I'm wrong again, wrong again)
I love you, I'm sorry
The way life goes
(You were the best but you were the worst)
(As sick as it sounds, I loved you first)
I wanna speak in code
(I was a dick, it is what it is)
(A habit to kick, the age-old curse)
Hope that I don't, won't make it about me
(I tend to laugh whenever I'm sad)
(I stare at the crash, it actually works)
I love you, I'm sorry


Title: I Love You (Snippet)

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I'd swim oceans just to see you
'Cause you're worth a hundred miles
And I never want to leave you
'Cause I'm always on your side

[Chorus]
You're my best friend and you don't even know it
I don't know how to show my love
I'll keep it locked away until you want me to stay forever
When will I be in love
I love you


Title: I miss you, I’m sorry

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Do you remember happy together?
I do, don't you?
Then all of a sudden, you're sick to your stomach
Is that still true?

[Chorus]
You said, "forever," in the end I fought it
Please be honest, are we better for it?
Thought you'd hate me, but instead you called
And said, "I miss you"
I caught it

[Verse 2]
Good to each other, give it the summer
I knew, you too
But I only saw you once in December
I'm still confused

[Chorus]
You said, "forever," and I almost bought it
I miss fighting in your old apartment
Breaking dishes when you're disappointed
I still love you, I promise
Nothing happened in the way I wanted
Every corner of this house is haunted
And I know you said that we're not talking
But I miss you, I'm sorry

[Outro]
I don't wanna go, think I'll make it worse
Everything I know brings me back to us
I don't wanna go, we've been here before
Everywhere I go leads me back to you (You said, "forever," and I almost bought it)
I don't wanna go, think I'll make it worse (I miss fighting in your old apartment)
Everything I know brings me back to us (Breaking dishes when you're disappointed)
I don't wanna go, we've been here before (I still love you, I promise)
Everywhere I go leads me back to you (Nothing happened in the way I wanted)
I don't wanna go, think I'll make it worse (Every corner of this house is haunted)
Everything I know brings me back to us (And I know you said that we're not talking)
I don't wanna go, we've been here before (But I miss you)
Everywhere I go leads me back to you
I don't wanna go, think I'll make it worse
Everything I know brings me back to us
I don't wanna go, we've been here before
Everywhere I go leads me back to you


Title: I’m Not Over Us (Snippet)

Lyrics:
[Verse]
Put you on my wall to remember us
A broken kind of love but it meant enough
Now, we don't even talk like we used to
I faked another thing to forget you
Telling all my friends that I'm over us
I'll just say I'm fine if you hit me up
Please don't expect a lot in particular
It's just you don't ever call like you used to
I'm sure you've heard that I missed you
Oh, oh I'm not over us


Title: Imy,imsorry

Lyrics:
None


Title: In Between

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I just can't come between 'em, they got their own thing
I wish he'd stop pretendin', he won't let his phone ring
For more than a couple seconds, oh, I think maybe two
Two hearts just fallin' in and out of love for somethin' new

[Verse 2]
I wish that you could see 'em, their faces lighten up
Their past is cold and empty, they know it's been enough
Of waitin' on somebody, someone who doesn't care
But he knows her name, she knows he'll always be there

[Chorus]
He laughs at her eyes, at her smile, at the glasses on her face
She loves how he talks late at night, when there's no one else to say
How she's beautiful and funny and smart like nothin' he's ever seen
He's good to her, and she wants it more than everything in-between

[Verse 3]
She toes the line between 'em, he says he's new at this
There's holy ground beneath them, and sparks fly when they kiss
He hates it when she's crying, he hates when she's away
Even at their worst, they know they'll still be okay

[Chorus]
He laughs at her eyes, at her smile, at the glasses on her face
She loves how he talks late at night, when there's no one else to say
How she's beautiful and funny and smart like nothin' he's ever seen
He's good to her, and she wants it more than everything in-between

[Bridge]
Everything in-between
Everything in-between

[Chorus]
He laughs at her eyes, at her smile, at the glasses on her face
She loves how he talks late at night, when there's no one else to say
How she's beautiful and funny and smart like nothin' he's ever seen
He's good to her, and she wants it more than everything in-between


Title: Into It (Snippet)

Lyrics:
Eyes open
Keep doors closed
And then turn down the lights
Don't know you
But I’m thinking you’re the one tonight
Quiet when you meet me
I might be unassuming oh
I'll dress up like somebody
Just tell me that you want me, oh

I'll fix your broken heart
Just say you’re into it
Come closer in the dark
I think I’m into it
I’m crazy, messed up, complicated
But I’m into it
I'll fix your broken heart
Just say you’re into it


Title: I Once Did (Snippet)

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I don't know when I’ll see you again
I want to drown in it
But every time that I get close
Someone else is in your bed
And she's on your skin
Does she love you like the way that I once did?
I once did, I once did
The way that I once did
I once did


Title: I should hate you

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Last night, I spiralled alone in the kitchen
Making pretend that the furniture listened
Wasn't the best of my mental conditions, but I tried
Thinkin' of you without any forgiveness

[Pre-Chorus]
Because I was the one who would stay up and call you
And I'd drive to your house for the shit that you went through
Then I wasted my breath when I tried to console you, didn't I?
'Cause we didn't happen the way we were supposed to

[Chorus]
I know that I should hate you
I know that I should hate you

[Verse 2]
Pulled the knifе out my back, it was right where you left it
But you aimеd kinda perfect, I'll give you the credit
I just drank something strong to try to forget, but it wasn't right
No, you're not even here, but you're doin' my head in

[Chorus]
I know that I should hate you
I know that I should hate you
I know that I should hate you
Ooh, ooh

[Bridge]
I should hate you, I feel stupid
Like I almost crashed my car
Drivin' home to talk about you
At my table in the dark
All I ever think about is
Where the hell you even are
And I swear to God I'd kill you
If I loved you less hard

[Verse 3]
After all of this time, I still get disappointed
Bet you're doin' alright and you don't even know it
How it's all 'cause of you that my standards are broken in my mind
I would bend back to you if you left the door open

[Chorus]
I know that I should hate you
I know that I should hate you
I know that I should hate you
Ooh, ooh
I know that I should hate you
I know that I should hate you
I know that I should hate you
Ooh, ooh


Title: I Still Sleep In Your Clothes

Lyrics:
[Verse]
If I listen again I'll go crazy, so I turn it off
Only drinking will help at this point, but I've had enough
I hate you so much
But I still sleep in your clothes

If you called it addiction
I'm thinking that you might be right
It's a lie when I tell all my friends that I can sleep through the night
I wake up needing you
Considered breaking my phone


Title: It’s Just Pain These Days

Lyrics:
None


Title: It’s Not Your Fault (Snippet)

Lyrics:
[Verse]
I've been thinking about your name
I see it in the spaces
Read between the lines
You're looking happier these days
I hate that I still want to feel you all the time
You got me drinking wine
And playing dumb
I lose my mind over a wasted love
A wasted time
It's not your fault


Title: I Want More

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Tell yourself you're over me
Then you let a couple drinks
Happen, happen
Usually I overthink
Call you back and blame it on
Habit, habit

[Pre-Chorus]
I still sleep in all your clothes
And I'm staying up alone
Like every night
I’m already going home
Just sitting by your phone
So we could try

[Chorus]
I want, I want more
I want, I want


Title: Keep Your Hands In Your Pockets (Snippet)

Lyrics:
[Verse]
Excuse my punctuation, but you're the complication now
I fell for what you said but
The walls you built, they only bring me down
You're broken and you're messed up
You almost took the best of me
We're right back where we left off
I'm begging you to let me be

[Chorus]
Don't call me back when you're sober
Never mind what I told you, just keep your hands in your pockets
Don't look at me like you know everything
'Cause you don't, just keep your hands in your pockets


Title: Let It Happen

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
No, I know
I'm a walking contradiction and it shows
Got a history of being in control
I'm aware that I could end up here alone

[Verse 2]
But then we spoke
I had a backbone made of glass and then it broke
Now I stay up and I wait here by the phone
If you're ready, all I mean is we could go

[Pre-Chorus]
I've never craved someone's attention
As much as yours, thought I should mention that

[Chorus]
I'd bet all my money that I will
Lose to you and hand you my life
Here's to hoping you're worth all my time
I might barely know you, but still
Don't love you yet, but probably will
Turn me into something tragic
Just for you, I let it happen

[Post-Chorus]
I let it happen

[Verse 3]
But it's fine
'Cause I can tell that I'm projecting half the time
I lack context so I've made up all these lies
It's the only thing that helps me sleep at night
(Hmm, mm, mm)

[Pre-Chorus]
And now I'm looking in the mirror
You made me vain, I can't believe I have to be her

[Chorus]
I'd bet all my money that I will
Lose to you and hand you my life
Here's to hoping you're worth all my time (Ah, ah)
I might barely know you, but still
Don't love you yet, but probably will
Turn me into something tragic
Just for you, I let it happen

[Post-Chorus]
I let it happen
I let it happen
I let it happen
I let it happen

[Bridge]
You've turned all my skies to pouring rain
Locked me out the house again
Is this how you see me? Now I'm reeling and I might
Break the windows, let myself back in
Lost it for a minute there
Get my shit together, it's whatever, but I could die
Knowing that you're probably out somewhere
While I'm in my underwear
Eating through my feelings, I'm still reeling, but it's fine
Oh, thank God that you're not seeing this
I'll spare you from everything
If you would still have me, I'll be waiting all my life
Oh-oh

[Chorus]
I bet all my money that I will
Lose to you and hand you my life (Ooh)
Here's to hoping you're worth all my time (I hope you're worth my time)
I might barely know you, but still (Still)
Don't love you yet, but probably will (Will)
Turn me into something tragic
Just for you, I let it happen
I bet all my money that I will (I'm letting it)
Lose to you and hand you my life (I'm letting it, ooh)
Here's to hoping you're worth all my time (I hope you're worth my time; I'm letting it)
I might barely know you, but still (Still)
Don't love you yet, but probably will (Will)
Turn me into something tragic
Just for you, I let it happen (I'm letting it, I'm letting it)

[Outro]
(Whatever) I let it happen
(Whatever) I let it happen
(Whatever) I let it happen
I let it happen (I'm letting it, I'm letting it)


Title: Long Sleeves

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Packing while you're asleep
You were the catalyst
I don't know what it is about how you breathe
About how you breathe
I want to be alone
Hate it that no one knows, you're good to everyone
All them but me
All them but me

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you hear me leaving in the morning
Could you just pretend that it was only wind?
'Cause I can't love you even if I want to
Got a lot to work through
You don't know where I've been

[Chorus]
It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming

[Verse 2]
Say something sweet to me
It never meant a thing
Used to the turbulence
I wore long sleeves
I wore long sleeves
Fought 'til you tethered me
Swept under surfaces
Never enough of it
You didn't think
You didn't think

[Pre-Chorus]
If you hear me leaving in the morning
Could you please pretend that it was only wind?
'Cause I can't love you even if I want to
Got a lot to work through
You don't know where I've been

[Chorus]
It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming

[Outro]
Coming down, I'm coming down, I'm coming down
I'm coming down, I'm coming down, I'm coming down
I'm coming down, I'm coming down, I'm coming down
I'm coming down, I'm coming down, I'm coming down
Coming down, I'm coming down, I'm coming down
I'm coming down, I'm coming down, I'm coming down
I'm coming down, I'm coming down, I'm coming down
I'm coming down, I'm coming down, I'm coming
Coming down, I'm coming down, I'm coming down
I'm coming down, I'm coming down, I'm coming down
I'm coming down, I'm coming down, I'm coming down
I'm coming down, I'm coming down


Title: Mean It

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Talk to me more
You're a little bit bored, I'm a little bit tired
We don't fight though
You've been acting so cold, I don't know what you wanted

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time we touch, it's like the last time
Holding onto something when it's not right
Tell me to my face that you are all mine
You don't know what I'm feeling

[Chorus]
And maybe that thing you said under your breath, you mean it
Holding onto thin lines 'til we just walk between them
Getting so loud, I can't pretend that I don't hear 'em
Maybe that thing you said under your breath, you mean it
I know you mean it

[Verse 2]
Do we let go?
Are we too far gone?
I don't know where we started
I guess I don't know
Where we took a wrong turn, everything got harder

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time we touch, it's like the last time
Holding onto something when it's not right
Tell me to my face that you are all mine
You don't know what I'm feeling

[Chorus]
Maybe that thing you said under your breath, you mean it
Holding onto thin lines 'til we just walk between them
Getting so loud, I can't pretend that I don't hear 'em
Maybe that thing you said under your breath, you mean it
I know you mean it

[Outro]
I know you mean it
I know you mean it
I know you mean it


Title: Messed Up

Lyrics:
[Verse]
Last time I saw you, oh, you let me down
But I will never tell you that
No, I will never tell you that
I told you that it was never you, it was me
And now I'm lying right behind your back
I'm lying right behind your back

[Chorus]
Please come around and say you want me
You left me on my own love
I told you I was messed up
You used to love me, you don't know me
But you let them pull me back l[?]


Title: Mess in California (Snippet)

Lyrics:
[Verse]
I'm a mess
In California
Haven’t left yet
I woulda told ya
But I'm packing the things in my room
Feel like I've got everything to lose
Bitter cold
Take the subway
Writing home
To my family
Bout how everything changes
So fast
And what I wouldn’t give to go
Back there
