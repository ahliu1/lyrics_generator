Title: 2 Hold U

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Is it a crime that I'm just trying to hold you?
To hold you?
Interlocking fingers and I'm ready, I told you
I told you
If I'm in love then why is my heart hurting?
Hurting?

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Everywhere that I go
I just see you, I see you
I wrote it down
I told my mom
My friends all know
We get along
I want you
To want me too

[Outro]
I want to kiss you
I want to love you
I want to touch you
I think too much
You


Title: 4,018

Lyrics:
I'll try to stay
In this room all day

How can I
How can I
How can I
Drinking wine
Drinking wine
Drinking wine

We're all drunk but it's night
Its not sinning but
I don't know why I can't keep down
The things that are in my life

You don't impress anybody
When you're 40
You don't impress anybody
When you're 18


Title: 4EVER

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Some things just aren't that simple
You called me wondering why I changed
Or why I don't look the same
Why I think so differently now

[Chorus]
Is it ever gonna change? Am I gonna feel this way forever?
Are you gonna be around for me to count on?
Is it ever gonna change? Am I gonna feel this way forever?
Are you gonna be around for me to count on? Count on
On-on-on, on-on-on-on-on
On-on-on, on-on-on-on-on
On-on-on, on-on-on-on-on
On-on-on, on-on-on-on-on

[Verse 2]
Some things just never seem to fade
I'm thinking about how we were on our first date
You understood the words I was saying
I knew I'd never let you get away

[Bridge]
Hold you tight, squeeze you right, tell you what I want
Put me in your bedroom and I'll sing a little song
Hold you tight, squeeze you right, give you all I've got
See you in the morning, over coffee, we'll talk, oh

[Chorus]
Is it ever gonna change? Am I gonna feel this way forever?
Are you gonna be around for me to count on?
Is it ever gonna change? Am I gonna feel this way forever?
Are you gonna be around for me to count on? Count on
On-on-on, on-on-on-on-on
On-on-on, on-on-on-on-on
On-on-on, on-on-on-on-on
On-on-on, on-on-on-on-on


Title: 7th gr8de

Lyrics:
[Intro]
Meet me a thousand years ago
A message written on your face, you watch the boys
Play soccer after school
And you swear they all look like tools

[Verse 1]
But I guess it's over now
You're not here and I'm not around
We'd watch tv and see the people 'cross the street
We like the time
Even though we're both hiding frowns

[Bridge]
In seventh grade
Seventh grade
Seventh grade

[Verse 2]
I never kissed a boy
You already killed me, [?]
You have told me the story
What was it like?
To be a lie
To be a lie
To be a lie
To be a lie
To be a lie

[Outro]
K-I-S-S, I-N-G
Sitting in the tree
Do you want me, like I do?
Like I do?
Like I do?


Title: Add Up My Love

Lyrics:
None


Title: Alewife

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
In Massachusetts
Only 30 minutes from Alewife
I lay in my room
Wonderin' why I've got this life
I met you by surprise
You were hangin' out all the time
But you know you saved me from doin'
Something to myself that night

[Verse 2]
You called me seven times
One, two, three, four, on the line
I didn't mean to scare you
Just had the thoughts in my mind
They showed up to my door
My parents didn't know what for
Swear I could've done it
If you weren't there when I hit the floor

[Verse 3]
It's been so long
And you've been my sister all along
But you know I'll be alright
Eighth grade was never that tight


Title: All The Time*

Lyrics:
Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse 1]
Don't write me off
I'm only getting started
Don't write me off
I'm only getting just started

[Chorus]
And I just want you all the time
I just want you all the time
I just want you all the time
I just want you all the time
(I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I)
(I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I)

[Verse 2]
You can say
You can say I'm overthinking (I do, I do)
(I do, I do)
You can say
You can say I'm just foolish

[Verse 3]
Don't write me off
I only want the mornings and the nights with you
Don't write me off
I'll gladly take the afternoon

[Chorus]
'Cause I just want you all the time
Really want you all the time
And I just want you all the time


Title: Alma Mater

Lyrics:
[Intro: Lana Del Rey]
Baby, I want ya
Test, test, test
Maybe you'd like some of Jack's newer stuff, or
One, two, one, two, one, two

[Chorus: Jack Antonoff, Lana Del Rey, Both]
She's my alma mater
Chasin' lines all night (Alma mater)
Smokin' me outta sight
Well, summer's gettin' hotter (Alma mater)
Threw her T-shirt down the pike (Alma mater)
Screamin', "Fuck Balenciaga"
Right past the Wawa (Alma mater)
Threw on "Heartattack and Vine"
As she alligator cries (Lana)
I'll make it darker
2003, sad all the time (Alma mater)

[Verse 1: Jack Antonoff]
(C'mon)
Point the headlights, flickеr dear
Drive by the old housе, go for a beer
We're on the green or the movie theatre
You're a movie to me, the way you move around me

[Chorus: Jack Antonoff, Lana Del Rey]
She's my alma mater
Well, summer's gettin' hotter (Alma mater)
Threw her T-shirt down the pike (Alma mater)

[Verse 2: Jack Antonoff, Lana Del Rey]
Some dreams, I wake up thinkin' 'bout
Some dreams are meant to die (Alma mater)
Kill Your Idols in the street outside in daylight
'Cause if we walk, we'll get high tonight
Shoulder to the wheel tonight
Joke about blowin' town tonight (Alma mater)
Until we drive past my alma mater

[Bridge: Lana Del Rey]
Alma mater

[Chorus: Jack Antonoff, Lana Del Rey, Both]
She's my alma mater
Chasin' lines all night
Smokin' me outta sight
Well, summer's gettin' hotter
Threw her T-shirt down the pike (Yeah)
Screamin', "Fuck Balenciaga"
Right past the Wawa
Threw on "Heartattack and Vine"
As she alligator cries (Lana)
I'll make it darker


Title: Amoeba

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Between the gaps, I was swimming laps
Got close to some epiphany
I'll convince a friend to join deep ends
Have your toes touch the lack of cement

[Pre-Chorus]
Gather to one corner of the woods
Echo chambers inside a neighborhood
And centerfold, humility shown
You're not as good as what your mama's sewn

[Chorus]
Aren't you glad that you reside in a Hell and in disguise?
Nobody yet everything, a pool to shed your memory
Could you say you even tried?
You haven't called your family twice
I can hope tonight goes diffеrently
But I show up to the party just to leavе

[Verse 2]
Between the gaps, keep it under wraps
How I got to some epiphany
I'll convince myself when it turns to twelve
The photos keep the sentiment

[Pre-Chorus]
Gather to one corner of the woods
Echo chambers inside a neighborhood
And centerfold, humility shown
You're not as good as what your mama's sewn

[Chorus]
Aren't you glad that you reside in a Hell and in disguise?
Nobody yet everything, a pool to shed your memory
Could you say you even tried?
You haven't called your family twice
I can hope tonight goes differently
But I show up to the party just to leave

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Pulling back, I tried to find
The point of wasting precious time
I sip and toast to normalcy
A fool's way into jealousy
I mock and imitate goodbyes
When I know that I can't deny
That I'll be here forever while
I show up to the party just to leave

Title: Anymore

Lyrics:
?


Title: ​a place we knew

Lyrics:
[Verse]
I don't need a thing from you
Stuck onto a place we knew
I used to think I knew you well
Now I don't think that I can tell

[Chorus]
I thought I was dreaming
I thought I was dreaming

[Verse]
I don't need a thing from you
Stuck onto a place we knew
I used to think I knew you well
Now I don't think that I can tell

[Chorus]
I thought I was dreaming
I thought I was dreaming


Title: ​aquarius boy

Lyrics:
Mama's got the velvet touch
She never seems to make a fuss

Louie tells me I'm okay
I don't need that boy anyway

Maybe our signs will align
I'm a Leo, a Leo, a Leo, and I never know what I want

Aquarius boy
You were mean to me


Title: Are You Bored Yet?

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Dylan Minnette with Clairo]
"What's wrong?"
You've been asking, but I don't have an answer
"How come?"
I'm still thinking, let's pretend to fall asleep now
When we get old, will we regret this?
Too young to think about all that shit
And stalling only goes so far when you've got a head start

[Chorus: Dylan Minnette with Clairo]
'Cause we could stay at home or watch the sunset
But I can't help from asking, "Are you bored yet?"
And if you're feeling lonely, you should tell me
Before this ends up as another memory
Will you tell the truth so I don't have to lie?
Will you tell the truth so I don't have to lie?

[Verse 2: Clairo]
Feels like I've known you my whole life
I can see right through your lies
I don't know where we're going
But I'd like to be by your side
If you could tell me how you're feeling
Maybe we'd get through this undefeated
Holding on for so long

[Chorus: Dylan Minnette with Clairo]
'Cause we could stay at home or watch the sunset
But I can't help from asking, "Are you bored yet?"
And if you're feeling lonely, you should tell me
Before this ends up as another memory
Will you tell the truth so I don't have to lie?
Will you tell the truth so I don't have to lie?


Title: Bags

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Every second counts
I don't wanna talk to you anymore, and
All these little games
You can call me by the name I gave you yesterday, yeah
Every minute counts
I don't wanna watch TV anymore, yeah
Can you figure me out?
Just doin' this to waste more time on the couch

[Chorus]
Can you see me? I'm waiting for the right time
I can't read you, but if you want, the pleasure's all mine
Can you see me using everything to hold back?
I guess this could be worse
Walking out the door with your bags
Walking out the door with your bags
Walking out the door with your bags
Walking out the door with your bags

[Verse 2]
Pour your glass of wine
Mitchell told me I should be just fine (Yeah)
Cases under the bed
Spill it open, let it rush to my head
I don't wanna be forward, I don't wanna cut corners
Savor this with everything I have inside of me
I'm not the type to run
I know that we're having fun
But what's the rush? Kissing, then my cheeks are so flushed

[Bridge]
Tell you how I felt
Sugar coated melting in your mouth
Pardon my emotions
I should probably keep it all to myself
Know you'd make fun of me
Know you'd make fun of me
Know you'd make fun of me
Know you'd make fun of me

[Chorus]
Can you see me? I'm waiting for the right time
I can't read you, but if you want, the pleasure's all mine
Can you see me using everything to hold back?
I guess this could be worse
Walking out the door with your bags
Walking out the door with your bags
Walking out the door with your bags
Walking out the door with your bags

Title: Bambi

Lyrics:
I'm stepping inside a universe
Designed against my own beliefs
They're toying with me and tapping their feet
The work's laid out, cut out to the seams
It's not that I crave any more company
I'd like to say, say a few things
Clearing your throat while I count to three
Keep hold of my hand
We both know I can leave

I don't like to cry before I know why
But honestly, I might
You pick a new fight, wiping tears from the night
Blue ribbon ties while emotions are high
I told all my friends
They were glad to see
Sat in a circle in front of my Claud's tapestry
In a dorm less than three minutes to drive
We both can always

"Take it or leave it
The moment's here and you should believe it"
Know that you should
I pull until I'm left with the burns
Blisters and the dirt left in between my fingers
Rushing so I can beat the line
But what if all I want is conversation and time?
I move so I don't have to think twice
I drift and float through counties with my one-sided climb

Once I make a choice to move forward, I'll take
I'll take a picture for your locker


Title: ​because ur a boy

Lyrics:
[Verse]
He'd be fine
With a heart like mine
Could he be
With a girl like me?
And I'll be ok
I've been this way
Because you're a boy
When he's near
Things become so clear
I need him
More than he needs me

[Outro]
Please, I need time
You know I'll be fine
'Cause you're a boy
Oh, 'cause you're a boy
'Cause you're a boy
You're a–
You're a–
You're a boy


Title: Better

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Clairo]
I know there's something right
Right in between us
I see you standing there
Want you to just trust
You make it hard for me
So hard not to stare
I'm moving closer baby
Why don't you seem to care?

[Pre-Chorus 1: Clairo]
All my life, thinking about all these times
Wanted someone like you
Hold me tight, but treat me right
All my life, needing someone to get by
What if I had it right from the very first time?

[Chorus: Clairo]
I want it better
I want it better
I want it better
I want it better for you

[Verse 2: Clairo]
I know it isn't right
You creep into the night
Maybe you want a friend
Maybe not in this life
Why is it so hard, hard to please you
All I wanted was you in my room

[Pre-Chorus 2: Clairo]
All my life, thinking about other guys
Never hit me like this
Cut me deep like a knife
All my life, tried so hard to be alright
What have you done to me
Blinded, I lost my mind

[Chorus: Clairo]
I want it better
I want it better
I want it better
I want it better for you
I want it better
I want it better
I want it better
I want it better for you
I want it better
I want it better
I want it better
I want it better for you


Title: Bittersweet

Lyrics:
You just got pranked <3


Title: Bladeless

Lyrics:
Call it all for nothing
But I rather be nothing to you
Than be a part of something
Of something that i didn't do ( Do you really want this? )

I can be the only one ( Did you even know this?)
I can the best to you
Be the best to you ( Do you really want to?)
I can be the only one ( Did you even know this?)
I can the best to you
Be the best to you

Part of me is faking
Faking it all just for fun
Part of me is breaking
Breaking apart when you're gone

I can be the only one ( Did you even know this?)
I can the best to you
Be thе best to you


Title: ​blazers

Lyrics:
Where the sidewalk ends it's hard to tell
I used to read that book by the wishing well
Take it off, take it off, your t-shirt
In the lake, in the lake, in the summer

Slip my blazers on
I don’t care about the mud that got on them
When will you come back to Boston?
It's getting harder without you


Title: Blouse

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Here we are, quiet at your kitchen table
With courtesy to little pet peeves
Napkins on laps, strands pulled back
I hang the scarf and my mom's anorak

[Chorus]
Why do I tell you how I feel
When you're just looking down the blouse?
It's something I wouldn't say out loud
If touch could make them hear, then touch me now
If touch could make them hear, then touch me now

[Verse 2]
Talking to some who laugh and others scorned
I guess humor could help me after all
It's funny now, I'm just useless and a whore
But I get a cosign from your favorite one-man show

[Chorus]
Why do I tell you how I feel
When you're too busy looking down my blouse?
It's something I wouldn't say out loud
If touch could make them hear, then touch me now
If touch could make them hear, then touch me now
If touch could make them hear, then touch me now
Now

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Light a candle I'll follow
I can't see in the dark
I'm not ready to go
I'm awake

[Chorus]
I can't stop, my teardrop falls like snow
Falls like snow
I can't stop, my teardrop falls like snow
Falls like snow
I can't stop, my teardrop falls like snow

[Verse 2]
Hearts are frozen, no words to say
I said I'd go and it's okay
But I-

[Chorus]
I can't stop, my teardrop falls like snow (snow, snow)
Falls like snow (snow, snow)
I can't stop, my teardrop falls like snow (snow, snow)
Falls like snow (snow, snow)
I can't stop, my teardrop falls like snow (snow, snow)

[Bridge]
I was your blue angel
I was your blue angel
I was your blue angel
I was your blue angel

Falls like snow (I was your blue angel)
I can't stop, my teardrop falls like snow


Title: ​blue eyes

Lyrics:
[Verse]
Something about your blue eyes
They reel me in with the moonlight
I'll be quite honest I was scared
Of how I'd survive the sea
And I can't get out of my head
Circling thoughts roll around my brain
What are you thinking? What am I doing? What is happening?
Maybe things would fall into place
But I have this feeling in my gut
That this could be something good for us
'Cause when I see you again
I think of you more than just a friend
I think of you more than just a friend
I think of you more than just a friend


Title: Blue Light

Lyrics:
There's a blue light
In my best friend's room
There's a blue light
In his eye

There's a blue light, yeah
I want to see it
Shine

There's a ship
That sails by my window
There's a ship that sails on by

There's a world under it
I think I see it
Sailing away
I think it's sailing
Miles crashing me by
Crashing me by
Crashing me by

There's a world
Outside my doorstep
Flames over
Everyone's hot
Don't you see them shining
I want to hear them
Beating for me
I think I hear them

Waves crashing me by
Crashing me by
Crashing me by


Title: Bobby Bell Holds the Plate with Two Hands

Lyrics:
Deconstruct all my energy
Take apart what's left of me
I can't find the pieces that you like
Tell me what's right, I'm feeling alone

Want to see it coming
Don't wanna be surprised
I'll look you in the eye
Tell you that it's alright
(Alright, alright)

(Oh)

Alright


Title: B.O.M.D.

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Stop, wait a minute
Tell me what you're thinking
Baby, I don’t know you so well
I'll put my heart in it (in it)
Hold me for a minute (minute)
Baby, I would never lie to you (lie to you)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Hold me close, tell me why
Put me in your bed at night
I wanna stay here forever
Hold me close, but don't you lie
Put me in your dreams at night
I shouldn't tell you this

[Chorus]
You're the boy of my dreams
You're the boy of my dreams
You're the boy of my dreams
You're the boy of my dreams
Of my dreams

[Verse 2]
Somedays I try to call
You never seem to fall for me at all
Baby, why you so cold?
I'm standing at your door
Don't understand why you ignore my love
It is so warm for you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And you're the boy of my dreams
It's not so hard to see why you're the one for me
I love you so dearly
You're the boy of my dreams
It's not so hard to see why you're the one for me
I love you so dearly

[Chorus]
You're the boy of my dreams
You're the boy of my dreams
You're the boy of my dreams
You're the boy, you're the boy
You're the boy of my dreams
Of my dreams


Title: ​born

Lyrics:
[Into]
You're the blood rushing through my head
Once blue and now is shades of red
Read all my secret forms
Ingesting my chloroform

[Verse 1]
Warmer than my body
You breathe strong and wholly
I’ve got holes in me
Corridors
Lead to nothing more
Than the dead ends
On my twin bed

[Verse 2]
You’re soft and gentle
Your touch helps me melt
My stone-cold heart
Given me a spare part
Didn’t leave me in the dark

[Outro]
If I could kiss you one last time
I'd tell you what I'd find
I spy with my eye
A grown body
Could’ve sworn it was me


Title: ​boys don’t cry

Lyrics:
I would say I'm sorry
If I thought that it could change your mind
But I know that this time
I have said too much
Been too unkind

I try to laugh about it
Cover it all up with lies
I try and laugh about it
Hiding the tears in my eyes
Because boys don't cry
Boys don't cry

I would break down at your feet
And beg forgiveness
Plead with you
But I know that it's too late
And now there's nothing I can do

So I try to laugh about it
Cover it all up with lies
I try to laugh about it
Hiding the tears in my eyes
Because boys don't cry
Oh, boys don't cry
Boys don't cry
No boys don't cry


Title: ​brite boy

Lyrics:
[Verse]
Bright boy I can help you
If you let me take your hand
Bring you right to promise land
Bring you right to promise
Bright boy I could love you
If you let me be your wife
Love you so for all my life
Love you so for all my
Waiting by the water
You return with eyes cast down
Bright boy what has made you frown
Bright boy what has made you
Waiting by the water
Sun is setting by the sea
Bright boy please return to me
Bright boy please return to

[Outro]
Bright boy I can help you
If you let me take your hand
Bring you right to promise land
Bring you right to promise


Title: ​​bubble gum

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Sorry I didn't kiss you
But it's obvious I wanted to
Bubble gum down my throat and it's a curse
But my luck couldn't get any worse

[Chorus]
'Cause I swallowed the bubble gum
Oh, and these seven years will be pretty dumb
Pink flowers grow from my skin
Pepto bismol veins and I grin

[Verse 2]
You look so nice in your shirt
It's sad because it just hurts
I'd do anything for you
But would you do that for me, too?

[Chorus]
'Cause I swallowed the bubble gum
Oh, and these seven years will be pretty dumb
Pink flowers grow from my skin
Pepto bismol veins and I grin

Title: ​burning question

Lyrics:
[Verse]
Put on your shoes 'cause that's what they want you to do
Put on your makeup, I've got too many scars to make up for it
I've never been to Insomnia Cookies
Maybe it's because all I do is worry
About you
About you
About you
About you

[Bridge]
Looking for the signs
Do you wanna hold mine?
Running out of time
The hourglass is almost on one side

[Outro]
So do you love me like I love you?
Burning question you're the only one in the room

Of the people you knew

Lyrics:
Caught me by surprise
I've been thinking of you, tonight
Every time me I leave
It gets harder and harder to try
I don't wanna die
Without trying something new
Baby, I've got a good feeling that it could be you


Title: ​change

Lyrics:
[Verse]
How are you today?
I saw your friends band play
A little show last night
It's not my thing
They were alright
You're in my dream last week
I'd like to hear what you think
We passed a house driving fast
The sun was shining on the grass
You made me stop and leave the car
You pulled my sleeve but not too hard
Remember when you took too much
I didn't mind being your crutch
We loved you then
It's not the same

[Outro]
I don't like how things change
I don't like how things change
I don't like how things change


Title: Change in my pocket

So I'll wait 'til the day that all comes back to me

Oh, and sometimes I feel crazy
Bruise my skin and feel it all over

[Chorus]
Everything’s changing
Everything’s changing about you
Oh, and

Everything’s changing about you

[Verse 2]
On Monday morning
Tears of an angel
I heard you
Oh and
Won’t you come back
Back to the nest
The one that once held you

Title: Clairo - Pretty Girl (CAT.FLP BLINDED LOVE FLIP)

Lyrics:
[Intro: Clairo]
Polaroid of you dancing in my room
I want to remember, I think it was about noon
It's getting harder to understand, to understand
How you felt in my hands, in my hands

[Chorus: Clairo]
And I could be a pretty girl
I'll wear a skirt for you
And I could be a pretty girl
Shut up when you want me to
And I could be a pretty girl
Won't ever make you blue
And I could be a pretty girl
I'll lose myself in you

[Bridge: Clairo]
I was so blinded by you, now I cry
Just thinking 'bout the fool that I was
I was such a fool
I'm alone now but it's better for me
I don't need all your negativity

[Chorus: Clairo]
And I could be a pretty girl
I'll wear a skirt for you
And I could be a pretty girl
Shut up when you want me to
And I could be a pretty girl
I'll nevеr make you blue
And I could be a prеtty girl
I'll lose myself in you


Title: Closer To You

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I feel it in my bones, even when I'm alone
Mama said, "I told you so," going down a different road
You call me late at night, I pick up every time
Wish that I could rewind, get some peace of mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Shut up, don't wanna hear it now, I'm fed up
Wish I could say it was enough, oh, to make me walk away
And I'm messed up 'cause every time I start to get up
And now my head feels fucked up, and I know it won't change

[Chorus]
The things you do
Only make me want to get closer to you
And the things that you say
Only make me want to stay

[Verse 2]
Can't push me away, I'm not going, I'll wait
You know this street runs two ways, say
So I need to hear your voice
Know I'm standing here by choice
And I can't hear the background noise, anyway

[Pre-Chorus]
Shut up, don't wanna hear it now, I'm fed up
Wish I could say it was enough, oh, to make me walk away
And I'm messed up 'cause every time I start to get up
And now my head feels fucked up, and I know it won't change

[Chorus]
The things you do
Only make me want to get closer to you
And the things that you say
Only make me want to stay

Title: ​​concentrate

Lyrics:
[Chorus]
I need you
Just to concentrate
Are you coming over?
I'm starting to smoulder
Like watercolour paint
And I need you
Allow me to demonstrate

[Verse]
And you
Smile like a tyrant
I take it on the chin
It's the modern way
I'm noticing a silence
Let's stick to trying
Making a display
An example too
Is an example rude
You tell me
Between the two of us
The things that ruin us
Are what makes me think

[Chorus]
That I need you
Just to concentrate
Are you coming over?
I'm starting to smoulder
Like watercolour paint
And I need you
Allow me to demonstrate

[Post-Chorus]
It's four in thе morning
You're in my apartment
And you're kissing my facе

[Bridge]
I need you
I need you
I need you
Just to concentrate
Well, I need you
Well, I need you
Well, I need ya

[Outro]
Light, light
Travel light when you're on your way (Real light if you make it out here)
Light, light
Travel light when you're on your way (Real light if you make it out here)
Light, light
Travel light when you're on your way (Real light if you make it out here)
Light, light
Travel light when you're on your way (Real light if you make it out here)


Title: Conducta

Lyrics:
[Clairo]
Wanna get by
Wanna get by
Ooh I wanna get by with you

Wanna get by
Wanna get by
Ooh I never got a goodbye

Something's telling you it's not right
Something's telling me it's not right
Something's telling me I'm not right
Something's telling me I'm right

I could be in your life
Something's telling me that I'm right
I could be in your life

[Osquello]
I'm staying level-headed
When what I say's embedded in my yute's mind
Tell ‘em grab, what you can before the time runs by
And we just getting by why
Cos the fickle lies that
Turn up in the wild nights are
Working and my mind's, circling, hurting around
All these different versions of
Situations, problems that never get rid of the certains
Washing fucking dishes for my salary it's pretty shit, but so ambitious
So the wishes that I'm wishing, are colliding slowly twisting with my baby and my distance, and the feeling's are persistent
What I'm reading is division, between the fucking people and the power of the visions
Invested in the crooks
Yet so skeptical with all the decisions

Stop grabbing the scissors
I'm cutting the tension
I am your wizard
Fuck up the mirrors
Fuck up the mirrors

[Nofunbuster]
Oh no, oh no, what a fun day
No fun has fun in a fucked way
High like a vogue model on the runway
Spliff stuffed like the roast on a sunday
Steez dirty like the dishes in the sink
I'll make you swim with the fishes if you think that you got clout
Take you down the route 666
I'm with some scumbag kids, that will switch
Like a blade
Your still in the starter
I will try to father you but your not my daughter or my son
More like a sister if I had one
I need a drink so I grabbed one
2 shots of that one, like you let off a gun
It's dumb, I'm dumb

[Clairo]
Wanna get by
Wanna get by
Ooh I wanna get by with you

Wanna get by
Wanna get by
Ooh I never got a goodbye


Title: CUCO x CLAIRO - DROWN (Audio)

Lyrics:
[Intro: Cuco]
Aye, man, c'mon man don't leave
Fuck, what the fuck
Why you leave me on read
I don't like this, fuck
Ahh

[Verse 1: Clairo]
If I told you what I'm thinking 'bout
It's hard to say to you but
I just know that I need some time alone
It's all I think about at night

[Chorus: Clairo & Cuco ]
I need some time away from you
Can't even be in the same room
I think I'm going crazy
Been home and lonely lately
What do you think about me
Can you fight or will you flee
Call me, you got my number
Don't let me go yet lover

[Post Chorus: Clairo & Both]
You're gone, I'm done, I'm all alone
You know, that I know
That you're not coming home
These days, I’m lost, you left me to drown, to drown
[Verse 2: Cuco]
Perdido en mi mente y buscando paraíso
But I can not find that si no estas aquí conmigo
Don't know what you're doing and I don't know who you with
En ruinas reina, sin tu yo aquí me quede
Con mis esperanzas falsas, casi siento que me matan
Regresa conmigo
Amor where did we go

[Chorus: Clairo & Cuco ]
I need some time away from you
Can't even be in the same room
I think I'm going crazy
Been home and lonely lately
What do you think about me
Can you fight or will you flee
Call me, you got my number
Don't let me go yet lover

[Post Chorus: Clairo & Both]
You're gone, I'm done, I'm all alone
You know, that I know
That you're not coming home
These days, I’m lost, you left me to drown, to drown

[Bridge: Both]
Stuck inside my mind I think I’ve lost it all
Free me from my thoughts, I think I've fallen off
Memories don't return, they seem to melt away
Dreaming of a world where I would wanna stay
[Post Chorus: Clairo & Both]
You're gone, I'm done, I'm all alone
You know, that I know
That you're not coming home
These days, I’m lost, you left me to drown, to drown


Title: Dangerous Game

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Marcus Mumford & Clairo]
Tennessee heat in a wood-panelled room
I put myself into his care again
In a high school chair for the visiting hour
From you of all people

[Verse 2: Marcus Mumford & Clairo]
Now he tells me to conjure you up
And so we meet again and again at the bottom of the garden
And I'm chasing a ghost all around the room
And now you're strung up on the ceiling
And it's you of all people

[Chorus: Marcus Mumford & Clairo]
It's a dangerous game to play with fire
For a brand-new mind
A dangerous game, a man on the wire
Get me out of my mind

[Verse 3: Marcus Mumford & Clairo]
Tied to the hope of another way through
It's chained at my ankles, they took away my shoes
Now I see the only way through is chained at the ankles
With you of all people
Get me out of my mind
Out of my mind
Out of my mind

[Chorus: Clairo, Clairo & Marcus Mumford]
It's a dangerous game to play with fire
For a brand-new mind
A dangerous game, it's a dangerous game
With you on my side
With you in my mind
A dangerous game, a man on the wire
Get me out of my mind


Title: ​dark room

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Lights off, I'm not here
Wish that you would call me "dear"
But now you can't
You know it's not right
You'll never know
What it's like

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Used to think I liked you
But all you do is make me blue
You don't care
And I can't resist
I guess I'll have to
Forget you exist


Title: ​d.c.p. (furnsss)

Lyrics:
[Verse]
Wake up or go to sleep
Why even try?
Why even try?
This all feels the same to me
Ready to die
Ready to die

[Chorus]
Tell me what it's like
Death called paradise
Death called paradise
Tell me what's inside
Tell me what's inside

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Tell me what it's like
Death called paradise
Death called paradise
Tell me what's inside
Tell me what's inside

[Outro]
Why even try?
Why even try?
Ready to die
Ready to die

Of your hand sometimes
Close to you

Count the freckles
On your body

Something I wish I didn't
Have to miss
Drew a dog
On the palm
Of your hand
Hope it's still there
When I see you again

Lyrics:
I never thought I'd ever be left alone

Title: ​drywall

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I can't get a ride to the Frankie show
I'm not as tall as all this snow
My friends and I walk through st. marks
Where you kissed me by search and destroy and it makes me wanna barf

[Verse 2]
Nick got a painting for free today
He doesn't really know what it is anyway
I get back home and slam my door
My world revolves around things that make me sore

[Chorus]
Ohh
Once I'm at home there's nobody to call
Oohh
Just wait for the train, until then stare at drywall

[Verse 3]
Jumping beans at the lake and wet grass
Summer's almost here it's coming fast
The bottoms of my shoes are wet from the snow
But at least i don't feel like your average joe

[Chorus]
Ohh
Once I'm at home there's nobody to call
Oohh
Just wait for the train until then stare at drywall


Title: DT

Lyrics:
I'll get aggressive now
Don’t have a choice won’t let you down
How did they ever get this far
I couldn’t tell you why I’m lost
Why I’m lost, why I'm lost
Why I’m lost, why I’m lost

In the summer, I'll unfold
My country with no hand to hold

Home of the free only for the white and manly
Oh the white and manly


Title: Duet

Lyrics:
[Chorus]
You've got nice eyes
They're very blue
That is why I look at you
I look at you
I look at you
I look at you
I look at you

[Verse]
Making a list
Of people to kiss
The list is a million you's long
Just you's all the way down
Olive oil soft
And laundry warm
I know I like you
I just don't know what for
With my boy Ronnie
Listening to Connie
I couldn't stop if I tried
I will love you til I die

Oh

Title: ​edge of desire

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Young and full of runnin', tell me where's that taken me?
Just a great figure eight or a tiny infinity
Love is really nothing but a dream that keeps waking me
For all of my trying, we still end up dying
How can it be?

[Chorus]
Don't say a word, just come over and lie here with me
You're about set fire to everything that I see
I want you so bad, I'll go back on the things I believe
There I just said it, I'm scared you'll forget about me

[Post-Chorus]
Forget about me, yeah
Forget about  me

[Verse 2]
So young, full of running all the way to the edge of desire, baby
Steady my breathing, silently screaming, "I have to have you now"
Wired and I'm tired, think I'll sleep in my clothes on the floor
Maybe this mattress will spin on its axis and find me on yours (On yours)

[Chorus]
Don't say a word, just come over and lie here with me
(Lie here with me, lie here with me)
'Cause I'm just about to set fire to everything that I see
I want you so bad, I'll go back on the things that I believe
But there I just said, I'm scared you'll forget about me

[Outro]
Scared you'll forget about me, yeah
Scared you'll forget
Scared you'll forget about me, yeah
So scared (I'm so scared)

Our one source of energy
The ultimate discovery
Electric blue for me
Never more to be free
Electricity
Nuclear and HEP
Carbon fuels from the sea
Wasted electricity
Our one source of energy
Electricity
All we need to live today
A gift for man to throw away
The chance to change has nearly gone
The alternative is only one
The final source of energy
Solar electricity
Electricity
Electricity
Electricity
Electricity
Electricity


Title: ​enemy

Lyrics:
If I asked you
You would tell me that you lied
You lied

I want to be your friend

If I wanted to be a part of something
I wouldn't ask you

I wouldn't ask you
I wouldn't ask you


Title: Everything I Know

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Close the door
I want some privacy, finally
And baby it's been so long, do you remember my body, my body?
You don't have to look further, I've got you, I can't hurt ya
That I've been gone so long
Things that I can't control, slip away before I know
I don't want this to go away

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
I think we should go so far away from here, so far away from here
I know a place
Places that we can go in-between the cracks and I'll just tell you everything I know
And I'll just tell you everything I know
And I'll just tell you everything I know
And I'll just tell you everything I know
And I'll just tell you everything I know

Title: Fallen Fruit

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
To the ones who came before us
All the golden ones who were lifted on a wing
We had no idea the dreams we had were far too big
Far too big

[Verse 2]
And we will walk together (We will walk)
Psychedelic garlands in our hair
Through the halls of splendor where the apple trees all grew
You'll leave us dancing on the fallen fruit

[Chorus]
The fallen fruit
The fallen fruit (Ooh)
The fallen fruit
[Bridge]
From the Nissan to the Phantom to the plane
We'll disappear in the cover of the rain
Took the great minds and the vapers
And a pocketful of seed
It's time for us to leave

[Verse 3]
And we will walk together (We will walk)
Psychedelic garlands in our hair
But how can I love what I know I am gonna lose?
Don't make me choose

[Chorus]
The fallen fruit
The fallen fruit
The fallen fruit


Title: Fall In Love

Lyrics:
[Intro]
(Mar-Mar-Marvy ayyyy!)

[Chorus: Lil Tracy with Clairo]
I can't even fall asleep, how could I fall in love?
I got like one hundred bitches, but she might be the one
She got a pretty face and a skinny waist
Finer than champagne, I just want a taste

[Verse 1: Lil Tracy & Lil Tracy with Clairo]
Yeah, she ask me if I want it and I said, "Yes"
She got a lot of style, but she look better undressed
She know I'm next, cause' they jock me like Drake jocked X (Ex, ex)
I'm a fucking prince and she my princess
You a bad bitch, please excuse my French
I'm a bandage, cause' she cut off her ex (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I can't even fall asleep, how could I fall in love?
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi

[Chorus: Lil Tracy with Clairo]
I can't even fall asleep, how could I fall in love?
I got like one hundred bitches, but she might be the one
She got a pretty face and a skinny waist
Finer than champagne, I just want a taste

I can't even fall asleep, how could I fall in love?
I got like one hundred bitches, but she might be the one
She got a pretty face, and a skinny waist
Finer than champagne, I just want a taste

[Verse 2: Clairo]
I can't even fall asleep, how can I fall in love?
Maybe you can be the one for me and be my drug
You get a little taste, hands around my waist
Don't you run, baby, don't make me chase
I could be yours tonight
I could be yours if you'd like
I don't wanna play no games
Baby, can you tell me what you think?

[Chorus: Lil Tracy with Clairo & Lil Tracy]
I can't even fall asleep, how could I fall in love?
I got like one hundred bitches, but she might be the one
She got a pretty face and a skinny waist
Finer than champagne, I just want a taste
I can't even fall asleep, how could I fall in love?
I got like one hundred bitches, but she might be the one
She got a pretty face, and a skinny waist
Finer than champagne, I just want a taste (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ayy!


Title: Favoritism

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I was in love for the second time
She told me not to lie
You said, honey, I can sense that you're
Struggling to find out what happened to you
On tour and alone with nothing to lose
Cried myself to sleep that night
I haven't wrapped my head around it
Maybe I should think about
Your hands on my sides, my shirt lost to wine

[Chorus]
When I turned around and said
"I can't believe you like me"
When I turned around and said
"I can't believe you like me better than the rest"
When I turnеd around and said
"I can't believe you likе me better than the rest"

[Verse 2]
Turns out kissing someone older
Doesn't mean there's gonna be a lesson attached
Say, I'm mature for my age
But there's a bed to be made, why don't you lie in it?
Swear I'll take this one to my grave
And nothing's gonna change
Oh man, it is the same
There's a child writing stories of when they become king
And learn to take everything

[Chorus]
When I turned around and said
"I can't believe you like me better than the rest"
When I turned around and said
"I can't believe you like me better than the rest"
Oh, better than the rest

Lyrics:
[Intro: Charli XCX]
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah

[Verse: Charli XCX & Clairo]
Know I keep on saying I'm alright
But every single night
When I cut off the lights
I feel like crying
Your picture revolving in my mind
But then it turns to white
I guess I’ll go in blind
I feel like crying
Hope you can forgive all of my crimes
You read, but won't reply
I just need your reply
I feel like crying
Baby, all I need's a single night
A sign, a sign, give me a sign

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
Sorry I broke you down
Sorry I tore your heart
I ripped it all apart
Your headlights in the dark
Sorry ’bout Grammy night
Was flyin' out my mind
Was in a different place
Tortured and drifting by
Kept dancing in that house
The windows turned to black
My windows turned to black
My eyes were rolling back, yeah
Hope I get one more chance
Hope I get one more call
I only know what's good once I have lost it all
Lost it all, lost it all, lost it all
Lost it all, lost it all, lost it all

[Post-Chorus: Charli XCX]
Hope you can forgive the things I've done
(Things I've done, things I've done)
Hope you can forgive the things I've done
(Things I've done, things I’ve done)
Hope you can forgive the things I’ve done
(Things I've done, things I’ve done)
Hope you can forgive the things I've done
(Things I've done, things I've done)
Reply, reply, give me a sign
Yeah

[Outro: Yaeji]
소-소-소심했던 나의

미안하다고
사과하고 싶어도
너무 늦은 걸까?

Travelled so far on my own
I don't know where I've gone
And I don't wanna be alone
When I am so far from my home

[Chorus]
You wanna feel something
But I don't feel nothing
Trying so hard to get over you

[Verse 2]
Wanna go back to the place where we started
At the party, I see you, but you keep your guard up
We could be something special if you wanted
I'm afraid that if we tried to, you would just give up
(You would just give up)

You wanna feel something
But I don't feel nothing
Trying so hard to get over you
You wanna feel something
But I don't feel nothing

Title: ​female energy

Lyrics:
I just landed in another atmosphere
I'm just floating, in a stain steel sphere
I bet you have questions like, "Where did I come from?"
I know,I come from that planet that hit Tiamat
Years ago
Years ago
Years ago
Years ago
I do my flows and then I get so lost
Light just take my spheres to go
Spheres to go
Spheres to go
Spheres to go
To the top of the pyramid, let's save the world like this
Conversing with light bodies (I know)
But really they all a part of me
Let's get the whip and go
'Cause I'm tired of this solar ring

Whatever (oh)
Whatever I do
Whatever
I don't care, get dressed whatever
I don't feel like talking, whatever

Cause it's really out of my control
How you feel is not my problem
I really don't want you to go, but I do not want to stop you
(stop you)
I do not want to stop you
I do not want to stop you
I do not want to stop you
I do not want you to stop you
I don't want to stop you

Title: Flaming Hot Cheetos

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel like I just wanna go back to my old ways
You're telling me I'm silly
It's no fun in the old days
I'm such a romantic
I never remember how things really happen
I guess you're attractive
Or something

[Verse 2]
Live in the moment
That's what they tell me
But what ever happened
To when you would hold me
And hold me
And hold me

[Pre-Chorus]
Girlfriend or girl, that's a friend?
It's easy just to pretend
That we don't have something real

[Chorus]
It's just how we feel
We feel
Oh, it's just how we feel
How we feel

I'm feeling something right

Title: For Now

Lyrics:

Pull the rug from underneath me now
Caught up in the landslide
Blindside on the ground

Loving you is simple, sweet
And I'm bound to fall

'Cause I'm loving you for now
Loving you for now
I'm loving you for now
Until it all breaks down

Let me see what I fear
What's it symbolize?
Would it make a difference if I learned at all?
Loving you is freeing me
Oil in your palm

I'm loving you for now
'Cause I'm loving you for now
Until it all breaks down

Baby don’t you know that I want you

Holding you close, breathing you in
Tryna hold back all the words that I’m thinking
I’m only myself around you we’re talking about your boo
Covers at night, holding me tight, just like a baby
I know I'm scared but I'm gonna be ok right here
Daydream about you
Daydream about you
Daydream about you
In my room
In my room

And I’ll save mine and I’ll stay mine
On road no inline state time
And don’t take mine and I take mine
Too worth too worth and I combine
Uh


Title: ​genesis of heaven

Lyrics:
[Intro: Marshall Applewhite]
Astro or in old language
A couple thousand years ago, disciples
Those who are trying to prepare themselves
For entry into the evolutionary level, above human
Synonymous with the Kingdom of God
The kingdom of heaven
Heaven, heaven, heaven

[Chorus: Grimes]
My heart, I never feel, I never see, I never know
Oh, heart, and then it falls, and then I fall, and then I know

[Break: Marshall Applewhite]
Your only chance to survive, or evacuate
Is to leave with us

[Chorus: Grimes]
My heart, I never feel, I never see, I never know
Oh, heart, and then it falls, and then I fall, and then I know
My heart, I never feel, I never see, I never know
Oh, heart, and then it falls, and then I fall, and then I know
My heart, I never feel, I never see, I never know
Oh, heart, and then it falls, and then I fall, and then I know

[Break: Marshall Applewhite]
Then you might survive

[Post-Chorus 1: Grimes]
My, my, my
Ever see, ever be, ever know my heart
Ever see, ever be, ever know my heart

Home, and I know
Playing the deck above
It’s always different
I'm the one in love
Home, and I know

Playing the deck above
It’s always different

Who do you think you are?
Rid themselves of human behavior, human activity, human thinking
The kingdom of heaven

[Chorus: Grimes]
My heart, I never feel, I never see, I never know
Oh, heart, and then it falls, and then I fall, and then I know
Ever see, ever be, ever know my heart
Ever see, ever be, ever know my heart

[Refrain: Grimes]
Home, and I know
Playing the deck above

[Break: Marshall Applewhite]
The planet is about to be recycled
And we see the planet as a stepping stone
Planet earth, a stepping stone

Home, and I know
Playing the deck above

Title: Gentle Boy

Lyrics:
Sorry I didn't kiss you
But it's obvious I wanted to
Bubble bubble down my throat and it's a curse
But my luck couldn't get any worse

You look so nice in your shirt
It's you look so nice in your shirt
You look so nice in your shirt
It's you you nice in your shirt
It's sad because it just hurts
Bubble gum down my throat and it's a curse
But my luck couldn't get any worse

'Cause sorry I didn't (you, you, you)
But it's obvious I wanted to
Bubble gum down my throat and it's a curse
But my luck couldn't get any worse


Title: Georgia*

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I just want to disappear
I like me most of the time, most of my years
Are spent with little say to lovers and friends
The people that I hold dear
Bring me back to Georgia when I was a kid
Perfect scenes and I'm reading
About me or him, how God, I wanna be
Someone important to everybody

[Verse 2]
Hey Claire, are you proud of yourself now?
Pushed away the only vows you knew before
You opened the door and never looked back
Don't you see you could've turned back?

[Verse 3]
Bring me back to Georgia, a little bit older
I promise I'll take up the offer
Go fishin' with Grandad, skip rocks with Abigail
Wash the clothes, my mother picked out the detail

[Outro]
Just wait another 20 years
It'll feel the same as it does right now
It'll feel the same as it does right now
Just wait another 20 years
It'll feel the same as it does right now

On the corner of Main Street
Get high with me
Sometimes I'm just still alone

Ooh-woo, ooh-woo
Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Bakar & Clairo]
We can fall from grace (Nah, nah, nah)

Tears run down my face (Nah, nah, nah)

[Chorus: Lancey]
Money can't change who I'm meant to be, my heart with a ghetto
My young boy right beside of me, ready to redrum
We can go eye to eye and see, who'll be the scared one?
Nobody I idolise, it's only me that I'm scared of

[Verse 2: Lancey]
It's only me in the ride at night, hop in the coupe and I tear off
Thinking 'bout when it's my time to die, could go, you know I got my bread up
Close my eyes, tryna watch my life, and I'm looking like, "Oh, it's you"
Age nineteen, what were you doing? Two hoes in the bed, one couldn't do it
Even the day that I hopped out the womb, I knew that I couldn't abide by the rule
I clocked this shit, I don't wanna go school, came last in class, first class what I flew
African man and I walk with the jewels
Walk with the blood, bring your gang, ring your crew
Ain't no man I could be scared of, ain't no man I could be scared of
Until I look in the mirror, ain't no one I could be scared of
Any girl, I pick a rare one, she wanna fuck 'til she give up
I know what I am, what I'm meant for, this story gonna bring tear drops
Open my eyes in the ride, I'm only scared of I, I

[Chorus: Lancey]
Money can't change who I'm meant to be, my heart with a ghetto
My young boy right beside of me, ready to redrum
We can go eye to eye and see, who'll be the scared one?
Nobody I idolise, it's only me that I'm scared of

[Verse 3: Monkey 67]
It's a vibe (Mhm), Western .40's when we pull up in the ride
You better hide, little nigga, don't act silly, bullets fly, little nigga
My bitch ain't Bonnie, but I'm Clyde with this nine or this spinner (Spinner), yeah
Bags under my eyes (Under my eyes), bags in the bank (Bags in the bank)
Bags stuffed in the shoe box (Uh, uh), yeah, we'll try make for tru' (Yeah)
You're my bro then we're splitting this food (Split it)
Used to rob niggas, still do (Mhm)
My advice, please don't get rude
Feds on my back, so more time, I'm cocoon

[Chorus: Lancey]
Money can't change who I'm meant to be, my heart with a ghetto
My young boy right beside of me, ready to redrum
We can go eye to eye and see, who'll be the scared one?
Nobody I idolise, it's only me that I'm scared of

My heart's beating, my heart's beating
I can't breathe when you tell me you're sorry
You're sorry

[Chorus]
All you tell me is that I'm not worthy
Of your love, your love
Of your love, your love
I can see that I don't have to be mad

Sweet Jane
A lock of my hair
A bookmark in your head, I'm just another person
Polaroid in your fragile hands
Tear the picture of us apart back together

[Verse 2]

I tend to put them on my windowsill
I want you to care for me
Don't you know I'm feeling blue?
Just another unreciprocated thing that I do


Title: Gladly

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
All I know, I got to be
With you, no reason not to be
Next to you, you next to me
Holding you, you're holding me
Time again, I want to leave
The way you look at me
I could be away from here
With no one, just you

[Chorus]
All I want is you
I love you
Gladly, gladly, gladly
All I want is you
I love you
Gladly, gladly, gladly

[Verse 2]
I don't want to sound so serious
But you are taking me away from all this hate
All it takes, all it takes
Is your arms, your smile
I like you
You're like to me
Closer than I've ever been
I want you around me
Always, always

[Chorus]
All I want is you
I love you
Gladly, gladly, gladly (Yeah)
All I want is you (Oh)
I love you
Gladly, gladly, gladly

Lyrics:
[Intro]
Did I ever tell you I'm vegan?

[Chorus: Lava La Rue]
You know that I ain’t blind
I can feel the tension, even when we're not together, even when we talk on FaceTime
Tell me it ain’t wishful thinking
Tell me, girl, I'm not wrong
You know that we more than get along baby (baby)

[Verse 1: Lava La Rue]
Lava, lava, I can make you get your dance on
Call me Molly 'cause I been rolling like a heartthrob
Bleming spirit just to keep all my lungs warm
I been living off my winnings so fast though, ah
All of that stopped when you caught my eye
So sweet from the top, you hollered at me
So I roll so soft, never play it safe cause I know what I want
I could be the girl of your dreams
I could be the ice to your cream
I could be the apple to your eye
So fly when I ride by caramel taste so sweet, woah
But I can’t lie, baby Benz, I think I like you
Why be friends when we were written like a haiku?
I’ll take it lightly, but if you like me
I’ma pull you so close, I’d do it rightly
And you and you and you know that you and me both would roll so widely
Scrap a Bonnie and Clyde
We Bonita and Clairo, I’m the G.O.Y.D

[Chorus: Lava La Rue]
You know that I ain’t blind
I can feel the tension, even when we're not together, even when we talk on FaceTime
Tell me it ain’t wishful thinking
Tell me, girl, I'm not wrong
You know that we more than get along baby (baby)

[Verse 2: Clairo]
Baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah
Before I wake up tomorrow
Wanna hold on to this situation
Like trickling water, grass like quilts
I wanna focus on the feeling
Don’t wanna mean it
Don’t wanna see you
With anybody but me
But it’s unlikely that I can make you stay
I’ll see you in my REM state

[Chorus: Lava La Rue]
You know that I ain’t blind (you know that I ain’t blind)
I can feel the tension, even when we're not together, even when we talk on FaceTime
Tell me it ain’t wishful thinking
Tell me, girl, I'm not wrong
You know that we more than get along baby (baby)


Title: Green Eyes

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Summer in my eyelids, eatin' rice and beans
Paintin' Kaia's bedroom, think she wanted green
But the weather puts you on my mind
Dragonfruit and peaches in the wine
Kissin' circles underneath your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Of course I know why we lasted two months
Could not hold my hand in public
Felt their eyes judgin' our love and baying' for blood
I could never blame you darlin' (Oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Chorus]
Some of these folks wanna make you cry
But you gotta trust how you feel insi-i-i-ide
And shine, and shi-ine, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
I wish that your parents had been kinder to you
They made you hate what you were out of habit
Remember when they caught us makin' out after school
Your dad said he felt like he'd lost you

[Pre-Chorus]
So I know why we lasted two months
Could not hold my hand in public
Felt their eyes judgin' our love and baying' for blood
I could never blame you darlin' (Oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Chorus]
Some of these folks wanna make you cry (Oh, oh)
But you gotta trust how you feel insi-i-i-ide
And shine, and shi-ine, yeah, yeah, yeah
Some of these folks wanna make you cry (Oh, oh)
But you gotta trust how you feel insi-i-i-ide (Oh, oh, oh)

My bed sheets surround me
Can't place myself in my surroundings
But my place has found me

[Chorus: Sitcom & Clairo]
And I forget my name
And I forget my name

[Verse 2: Sitcom & Clairo, Both ]
So I curl up in a familiar pose (Familiar pose)
Wrap my body around a pillow

Until I'm only thinking about videos

[Chorus: Sitcom & Clairo]
And I forget my name
And I forget my name

[Verse 3: Clairo]
Green fleece around me
Got my bed sheets around me
Silhouettes in the window
Who are they, I don't know>
Maybe they're actors on the TV show, with the TV glow
TV show, with the TV glow
The TV show, with the TV glow

I forget my name (I forget my name)
And I forget my name

[SOLITUDE, Clairo, both]
I just wanna guide you away from your demons, won't you let me?
Pick up the phone, babe it's all i ask, i just wanna hear your voice
Talk to me, lets communicate, you can talk about whatever it is that you wanna to say
Ill listen anyway, i just don't want this to be a one-way (One way)

Believe in me, when i say we were meant to be
It just can't keep going on this way
We need to change it up before it's too late
Girl we need to start to communicate
I really enjoy our time, i hope you can tell
Just don't let your mind dwell
Ill be there for you for as long as you need
I'm yours forever to keep
Just talk to me, we can figure it out
I just want the best for you, girl
You know my intentions are so, so pure
So...

Don't take my time for granted, one day i can't take it anymore and i'll be gone
So, appreciate for now
Cry later when i'm gone
Just leave me to rot
Maybe, i'll find a better place to be
Cus right now, this world ain't for me

Give me a reason not to leave
Tell me you're here for me
Give me a reason not to leave
Tell me you're here for me
Just don't leave, just don't leave me
We can talk, we can sleep baby
I just need you by my side
So come on over and take my hand, i'll take you for a ride (just don't leave)
But not tonight (just don't leave me)
Yeah, not tonight
Just text me back...


Title: Hace tiempo que...

Lyrics:
[Letra de "Hace tiempo que..."]

[Intro Instrumental]

[Estribillo]
Ya hace tiempo que no pienso en
Lo que hacíamos cuando estábamos tú y yo
Cuando estábamos tú y yo
Solos en la habitación
Puede que esto fuese
Únicamente un toque de atención
Uh-oh-oh, tú y yo, na-na-na-na-na

[Verso 1]
Y si me besas, te lo juro, no sé porque
Pero se para el tiempo cuando rozo tu piel
Porfa, quédate, creo que lo empiezo a entender
Que si no estoy contigo todo se puede romper (Yeah)

[Estribillo]
Ya hace tiempo que no pienso en
Lo que hacíamos cuando estábamos tú y yo
Cuando estábamos tú y yo
Solos en la habitación
Puede que esto fuese
Únicamente un toque de atención
Uh-oh-oh, tú y yo, na-na-na-na-na

[Verso 2]
Aunque ya no me acuerdo muy bien de tu cara
En mis sueños me atraviesas como una bala
Tú eres Prada, vales cara
Esos culos de portada no te remplazan por nada y dime
¿Te va bien?, ¿quién es él?
No lo entiendo, está contenta y no tengo nada que ver (No, no)
Y aunque ya no hablemos (Me entran ganas de decirte que)

[Estribillo]
Ya hace tiempo que no pienso en
Lo que hacíamos cuando estábamos tú y yo
Cuando estábamos tú y yo
Solos en la habitación
Puede que esto fuese
Únicamente un toque de atención
Uh-oh-oh, tú y yo, na-na-na-na-na

[Outro Instrumental]


Title: ​hair dye

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I wanna talk to you, but you know I can't possibly do that
It's just a habit I have
I dyed my hair blonde two days after you left
I feel better

[Verse 2]
Maybe I'll go purple or white
Just as long as you can't recognize me from behind
It's not that I am trying to avoid you
I just have to forget what you said about my blue
I suppose


Title: Harbor

Lyrics:
Okay, I'm finished now
And I kept my faith for long enough
And I hope I'm old and fairly sober
If I'm let down
Maybe you keep me around
For the constant affirmations
While I scrounge for understanding
And fall out
I'll let you win and I'll let you tie
The ribbon to my hair
Just so that we could come back to this
If we really cared
The morning gates stay open
If you had a thought that I'd be there
Oh, I'd be there

Ooh, ooh
Ooh

Know we could use a break
Because I can't feel my feet
Carried you all the way upstairs
So you can sleep and I can think

Stand guard when I am near
Clinging on to everything you fear
Keeping mе close while you hold me out and say
"I don't lovе you that way"
Harbor myself away from everyone else
I'm half-awake and intimate
Eyes closed and I'll commit
What I wish I had with you
I'll pretend until it's true
I don't love you that way
Swallow the pill, it's only fair that I hear
Know myself better than I have in years
I don't know why I have to defend what I feel
I try

Stand your guard when I am near
Loathe me until you're reminded of the deal
One of us knows when you hold me out and say
You don't love me that way
