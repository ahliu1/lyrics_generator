Title: 7 rings

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)
[Verse 2]
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, "Which one?" I say, "Nah, I want all of 'em"
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms

[Pre-Chorus]
My smile is beamin' (Yeah), my skin is gleamin' (Is gleamin')
The way it shine, I know you've seen it (You've seen it)
I bought a crib just for (Just for) the closet (Closet)
Both his and hers, I want it, I got it, yeah

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Baby)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it (Oh yeah)
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)

[Verse 3]
Yeah, my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag, but I be like, "Put it in the bag," yeah
When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it, then that's what I get, yeah

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah)
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah, yeah)

Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with bows and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing (Yeah)

Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it

Lyrics:

A-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh (a-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh)

[Verse 1]
You went to school to learn, boy
Things you never, never knew before
Mmmhmm, like "I before E, except after C"
And why two plus two makes four
Now, now, now I'm gonna teach you all about love, boy
Sit yourself down, take a seat
All you gotta do is repeat after me

[Chorus]
A, B, C
Easy as 1, 2, 3
Or simple as do-re-mi
A, B, C
1, 2, 3, baby, you and me, boy

Or simple as do-re-mi
A, B, C
1, 2, 3, baby, you and me, boy

[Verse 2]
Reading, writing, arithmetic
Are the branches of the learning tree
But without the roots of love every day, boy
Your education ain't complete
Te-te-te-teacher's gonna show you how to get an "A" (how to get an "A")
Spell "me" and "you" and add the two
Listen to me, baby, that's all you gotta do

[Chorus]
A, B, C
Easy as 1, 2, 3
Or simple as do-re-mi
A, B, C
1, 2, 3, baby, you and me, boy
A, B, C
Easy as 1, 2, 3
Or simple as do-re-mi
A, B, C
1, 2, 3
That's how easy love can be
That's how easy love can be
Sing a simple melody
1, 2, 3, baby, you and me

[Interlude]
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon boy

[Bridge]
Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it shake it, baby

Do-re-mi, baby

Easy as 1, 2, 3
Or simple as do-re-mi

1, 2, 3, baby, you and me, boy

[Bridge]
Lemme teach how to sing it out
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, lemme show you what it's all about

[Chorus]

Title: A Hand for Mrs. Claus

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Idina Menzel]
Every December, we always remember
To celebrate the fella in the suit
We see the promos for reindeer and his glow nose
Believe me, I think Rudolph's nose is cute
Now I'm a fan of Frosty, I go ga-ga for The Grinch
But beneath the hype, are they the type you'd turn to in a pinch?
There's someone more deserving of applause
How 'bout a hand for Mrs. Claus
Mm

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
I'm not complaining, I'm sure it's very draining
Pulling off a Christmas Eve world tour
My point in this is it's his marvelous missus
Who gets it done the other three-six-four
Who's really checkin' all those lists
And fillin' all them shelves
She's a master multitasker who works faster than the elves
Who keeps the North Pole hot 'til winter thaws
The answer's clear, it's Mrs. Claus, mm

[Verse 3: Idina Menzel, Ariana Grande, and Both]
She reads every Christmas letter
Fills out a Christmas sweater
Better than old Santa any day
She runs the operation
With no appreciation
Send a little Christmas love her way
Oh, oh yeah

[Interlude: Idina Menzel]
She just gets no respect
She works so hard

[Outro: Idina Menzel, Ariana Grande, and Both]
Now I'll sing a fa-la-la
And I'll shout a ho-ho-ho
But I'm bouncin' out this ballad for the gal who runs the show
Join me in this very worthy cause
How 'bout a hand for (Oh, oh, yeah)
Let's make it grand for (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Everybody stand for Mrs. Claus


Title: Ain’t About What You Got

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Yeah!
I heard a couple of bad things when you were with me
I used to think it was gossip I shouldn't believe, my bae
And I was going around thinking you were my baby (Oh, yeah)
Boy, you were taking the sugar from every lady (Oh, yeah)

[Pre Chorus]
Oh, it went on and on and on
Yeah, it went on for way too long
Oh, baby

[Chorus]
It ain't about what you got
It's all about what you do with it
Ain't about what you got
It's all about what you do with it
How does someone so sexy be so damn repulsive, baby?
It ain't about what you got
It's all about what you do with it

[Verse 2]
Baby, all of my ladies will hit me up saying (Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
You better open your eyes, girl
Your boy's been playing (You know)
Oh yeah
And even though on the outside, you're looking so tasty (Oooh yeah)
Well baby boy, on the inside you're nothing but shady
Na na na na na na

[Pre Chorus]
Boy, it went on and on and on
Yeah, it went on for way too long
Oh, baby

[Chorus]
It ain't about what you got
It's all about what you do with it
Ain't about what you got
It's all about what you do with it
How does someone so sexy be so damn repulsive, baby?

Went on for way too long
Oooooooooh

It's all about what you do with it

How does someone so sexy be so damn repulsive, baby?

Title: A Little More Homework

Lyrics:
Evan:
If you stand here behind me
And you call me a man
And you’re counting on me to come through
You should know that I’ll give you the best that I can
But we all have a little more homework to do

If you’re walking beside me
And you wanna be friends
You should know I’m depending on you
So you gotta hang in there till the whole story ends
Cause we all have a little more homework to do

Cause I’ve been looking in the back of the book for the answers
Hoping the bell wouldn’t chime
But I’m not ready to put down my pencil just set
There are too many answers that I didn’t get
I need a little less pressure and a little more time

I’m trying to follow
I’m trying to lead
I’m trying to find what is true
But if you’re going to stand with me
Then you have to concede
That we all have a little more homework to do

Charlotte:
Day turns, today turns, today turns, today turns, today turns, today
You get a little bit older
A little bit taller
A little bit better
A little bit
Day turns, today turns, today turns, today turns, today
And the days before all go too fast
You can’t hold on
So, you go

Evan & Charlotte:
Day turns, today turns, today turns, today turns, today turns, today

Evan:
I’m a little bit older
A little bit stronger
A little bit smarter
A little bit

Evan & Charlotte:
Day turns, today turns, today turns, today turns, today

Charlotte:
And the days ahead coming on so quick
You can’t keep running

All:
Day turns, today turns, today turns, today turns, today turns, today
And I’m a little bit older
A little bit faster
A little bit closer
A little bit
Day turns, today turns, today turns, today turns, today
And the sky goes blue
And the sky goes black
And no matter what you do
You can’t go back
You go day into day into day

Evan:
I turned 13, my parents got divorced and I moved from New York City to the middle of nowhere

All:
Day into day into day

Patrice:
I turned 13 and I kissed a boy more than once!

Kendra:
I turned 13 and I signed a virginity pledge

All:
Day turns, today turns, today turns, today turns, today turns, today

Lucy:
I was diagnosed with an eating disorder

Eric:
I failed math, but we won the championships!

All:
And I’m a little bit braver
A little bit broader
A little bit brighter
A little bit

Archie:
I turned 13 and I had to have spinal chord surgery. God, that sucked

All:
Day turns today turns today

Eddie:
I got busted for driving my dad’s pick-up

All:
Day turns today turns today

Charlotte:
I got drunk!

Cassie:
And I’ve been looking in the back of the book for the answers
Hoping the bell wouldn’t chime

Malcolm:
My parents split up

Molly:
And I’m not ready to put down my pencil just yet

Richie:
There are too many answers that I didn’t get

Simon:
I need a little less pressure

All:
And a little more time
I’m trying to follow
I’m trying to lead
I’m trying to learn what is true
I’m trying to be what you want and I need
But we all have a little more homework
We all have a little more homework
We all have a little more homework to do
Day turns, today turns, today turns, today turns, today turns, today
A little more homework to do
Day turns, today turns, today turns, today turns, today turns, today
A little more homework to do
Day turns, today turns, today turns, today turns, today turns, today
A little more homework to do
Day turns, today turns, today turns, today turns, today turns, today
A little more homework to do
Day turns, today turns, today turns, today turns, today turns, today

Evan:
My name is Evan Goldman, I live at 24 Plains Drive, Appleton, Indiana
I’m 13 years old’and I’m just getting started


Title: All I Want for Christmas Is You

Lyrics:
[Intro]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, yeah

[Verse 1]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
Don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day

[Chorus]
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

[Verse 2]
Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click

[Chorus]
'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do?
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

[Bridge]
Oh, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need?
Won't you please bring my baby to me?

[Verse 3]
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for (Ah)
I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door

[Chorus]
Oh, I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you

[Outro]
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby


Title: All I Want is Everything

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I feel delirious
Come, let’s get out of here
We’re so anonymous, but it’s all coming clear
We're heading for the sky, and we'll get lost in it
'Cause all I want, all I want, all I want is everything

[Pre-Chorus]
And I will pose if I wanna
And I will vogue like Madonna
I might not dance like M.J., R.I.P
But I will give the best of me

[Chorus]
All I want is everything, yes, everything
Too much is not enough
I’m sick of settling for in between, and I’m not giving up
As long as it feels right, at least we know that we’re alive
All I want is everything, yes, everything, yeah, whoa

[Verse 2]
We don't ever stop, let's watch the sun come up
We'll sleep when we're dead 'cause halfway kind of sucks
We're heading for the sky, and we'll get lost in it
'Cause all I want, all I want, all I want is everything

[Pre-Chorus]
And I will pose if I wanna
And I will vogue, like Madonna
I might not dance like M.J., R.I.P
But I will give the best of me

[Chorus]
All I want is everything, yes, everything
Too much is not enough
I’m sick of settling for in between, and I’m not giving up
As long as it feels right, at least we know that we’re alive
All I want is everything, yes, everything, yeah, whoa

[Bridge]
Hold onto me, and I'll hold onto you
Don't overthink, what have we got to lose?
It's me and you, me and you, no matter what, oh, oh

[Breakdown]
We're heading for the sky, and we'll get lost in it
'Cause all I want, all I want, all I want is everything

[Pre-Chorus]
And I will pose if I wanna
And I will vogue, like Madonna
I might not dance like M.J., R.I.P
But I will give the best of me

[Chorus]
All I want is everything, yes, everything
Too much is not enough
I’m sick of settling for in between, and I’m not giving up
As long as it feels right, at least we know that we’re alive
All I want is everything, yes, everything, yeah, whoa


Title: All My Love

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Sometimes I think we're the brightest stars
And I try to believe we'll find a way
Will life change, will our hearts turn colder? (Major Lazer)
All the rhythms in my heart lift me up inside
We can stay out of the trouble, is it worth the blame?
Is it true that the more you give, the more they take?
All the rhythms in my heart lift me up and say

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Only love will make us ache
Only love is worth the chase
All my love, I know we're waiting for this
On the rocks up on the mountaintops

[Post-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
All my love
All my love
All my love
Up on the mountaintop

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
All the rhythms in my heart lift me up and say
We're just a mess of broken people but we love the game
I would do anything for us, it's worth the pain
All the rhythms in my heart lift me up and say

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Only love will make us ache
Only love is worth the chase
All my love, I know we're waiting for this
On the rocks up on the mountaintops

[Post-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
All my love
All my love
All my love
Up on the mountaintop
All my love
All my love
All my love
Up on the mountaintop

[Bridge: Ariana Grande]
You're always on my mind
Oh, there'll come a day
Day where we can fly
Reach the glory haze, oh, hey
High up in the sun in the brighter sky
Sun in the brighter sky

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Only love will make us ache
Only love is worth the chase
All my love, I know we're waiting for this
On the rocks up on the mountaintops

[Post-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
All my love
All my love
All my love
Up on the mountaintop
All my love
All my love
All my love
Up on the mountaintop

Title: Almost is Never Enough

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I'd like to say we gave it a try
I'd like to blame it all on life
Maybe we just weren't right
But that's a lie, that's a lie

[Pre-Chorus]
And we can deny it as much as we want
But in time our feelings will show
'Cause sooner or later we'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is, everyone knows

[Chorus]
Almost, almost is never enough
So close to being in love
If I would have known that you wanted me the way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each other's arms
And we almost, we almost knew what love was
But almost is never enough

Title: Baby, It’s Cold Outside

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Larry Lovestein & Ariana Grande]
I really can't stay, but baby it's cold outside
I got to go away, but baby it's cold outside
This evening has been—, been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice, I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice
My mama will start to worry, beautiful, what's your hurry?
My daddy will be pacing the floor, listen to the fireplace roar
Really I better scurry, beautiful, please don't hurry
Maybe just half a drink more, put some records on while I pour
The neighbors might think, baby, it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink? No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how, your eyes are like star light
To break this spell, I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
I ought to say: "No, no, no, sir," mind if I move in a bit closer?
At least I'm going to say I tried, what's the sense of hurting my pride?

[Chorus: Larry Lovestein, Ariana Grande & Both Harmonizing]
I really can't stay, baby, don't hold out
Baby, it's cold outside

[Verse 2: Larry Lovestein & Ariana Grande]
I simply must go, baby, it's cold outside
The answer is no, baby, it's cold outside
The welcome has been—, how lovely that you dropped in
So nice and warm, look out the window and see the storm
My sister will be suspicious, gosh, your lips look delicious
My brother will be there at the door, waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious, gosh, your lips look delicious
Maybe just a cigarette more, never such a blizzard before
Gotta get home, but baby, you'll freeze out there
Say, lend me your coat, get on your knees right there
You've really been grand, I thrill when you touch my hand
But don't you see, how can you do this thing to me?
There's bound to be talk tomorrow, think of my life long sorrow
At least there'll be plenty implied, if you caught pneumonia and died

[Chorus: Larry Lovestein, Ariana Grande & Both Harmonizing]
I really can't stay, baby, don't hold out
Baby, it's cold outside

[Outro: Ariana Grande]
I like that one


Title: Baby Loves

Lyrics:
[Verse]
Baby loves, I'm tryna to talk to you
There's a boy and I don't quite know what to do
Good things come to those who wait
But patience ain't my thing
The way he holds me shows me he's the one
For sure the one
Think I'd rather wait for him, forever
Instead of having him, just for now
At night, just when I look up at the moon
I wonder if he's lookin' at it too
And I don't know what to do


Title: Bad Decisions

Lyrics:
[Intro]
No, yeah
Hey

Boy, you know that you drive me crazy

But it don't matter what they say
'Cause you know when you hear me knockin'
Gonna get that, ooh-ooh

You've become my favorite sin
So let 'em keep, let 'em keep on talking

We got that hood love
We got that good love
We got that hot love
We got that "I don't give a what" love

We got that hood love

Make me make bad
Boy, you make me make bad decisions
Bad
Boy, you make me make bad decisions

[Verse 2]
No, they ain't gonna understand it
Understand what I see in you
They don't know when you touch my body
That I see the truth
Let 'em keep, let 'em keep on talking
'Cause I know that I got someone
Anytime that I need some danger
Gonna get that, ooh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been doing stupid things (Ah)
Wilder than I've ever been
You've become my favorite sin
So let 'em keep, let 'em keep on talking
That's right

[Chorus]
We got that hood love
We got that good love
We got that hot love
We got that "I don't give a what" love
We got that one life

Boy, you make me make bad decisions (Boy, you make me)
Bad
Boy, you make me make bad decisions (Boy, babe)

[Bridge]
Nah, yeah
Don't you know I ain't fuckin' with them good boys?

If you want it, boy, you got it
Ain't you ever seen a princess be a bad bitch?

[Chorus]
We got that hood love
We got that good love
We got that hot love
We got that "I don't give a what" love
We got that one life
Gimme that all night

'Cause I don't wanna roll with it (Yeah, yeah)
Tryna get control of it (Yeah, yeah)
Why can't I let go of it? (Yeah, yeah, mmm)
Gotta find somebody quickly, yeah

I got a bad idea
How 'bout we take a little bit of time away?
I got a bad idea
Forget about it, yeah, forget about him, yeah
Forget about me (Ari-Chan)
I got a bad idea (Uh-huh)
Yeah, I'ma call you over here to numb the pain (Ari-Chan)
I got a bad idea (Uh-huh)
Forget about it, yeah, forget about him, yeah

Gotta get control of it
Why can't I let go of it? (Ooh)
Wishin' you would come and save me

How 'bout we take a little bit of time away? (Ari-Chan)
